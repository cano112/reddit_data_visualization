This is a moderated subreddit. It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion about all things related to books, authors, genres or publishing in a safe, supportive environment. If you're looking for help with a personal book recommendation, consult our [Suggested Reading](/r/books/wiki/suggested) page or ask in: /r/suggestmeabook

# Quick Rules:

1. **Discussion is the goal**  
Do not post shallow content. All posts must be directly book related, informative, and discussion focused. 

2. **Personal conduct**  
Please use a civil tone and assume good faith when entering a conversation.

3. **Prohibited**  
Promotional posts, comments & flairs, media-only posts, personal recommendation requests incl. ‘Should I read …?’, ‘What’s that book?’ posts, sales links, piracy, plagiarism, low quality book lists, unmarked spoilers (instructions for spoiler tags are in the sidebar), sensationalist headlines, novelty accounts, low effort content. *Please see extended rules for appropriate alternative subreddits, like /r/suggestmeabook, /r/whatsthatbook, etc. or use the Related Subreddits buttons in the sidebar.*

4. **Encouraged**  
We love *original* content and self-posts! Thoughts, discussion questions, epiphanies and interesting links about authors and their work. We also encourage discussion about developments in the book world and we have a flair system. 

5. **Important**  
We don't allow personal recommendation posts. You can ask in our Weekly Recommendation Thread, consult our [Suggested Reading](/r/books/wiki/suggested) or [What to Read](/r/books/wiki/whattoread) page, or post in /r/suggestmeabook.

##Rules

1. All posts must be [wholesome memes.](http://picturelements.github.io/wholesomesurvey)

1. Be general, not specific.  Memes should be relatable, with universally uplifting themes.     

1. Please avoid submitting NSFW content.

1. Please do not troll, harass, or be generally rude to your fellow users. Keep comments civil and be respectful of your fellow users. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5qd45d/swearing_and_wholesome_memes/)    
Be nice. This is a happy place.     
No proselytizing. Keep your religion, your politics, your diet, and any other crusade you might carry to yourself. We come here to get away from arguing and politics and the like, so please respect that by keeping your agendas to yourself.

1. Please do not post personal info, yours or others. All names should be blocked out, except public figures.  Also, private communication is private; please don't post it here.  

1. Please link to images directly. This makes browsing easier for those using RES or through a mobile device.

1. Please do not mention upvotes in your post. No ""Upvote in..."", ""Upvote if..."", ""you've been visited by..."", ""stop scrolling"", or ""for those who sort by new"" type titles or memes, nor other posts mentioning karma. [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/at90kp/new_posts_added_to_rule_7/)

1. Please avoid re-posting memes. (Browsing Top/New posts can help, also [Tineye](https://www.tineye.com/) & other image searches.) 

1. Please make an effort with your title. Avoid generic titles, try to be descriptive or fun.

**Official Subreddit of the PC Master Race** We're the largest community of PC enthusiasts on the Internet. [Begin your ascension today](//pcmasterrace.org/guide)!

#General Information

* Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
* Every kind of PC related content is welcome here. This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.
* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to recognize that the PC is the superior platform [as explained here](//goo.gl/p4urql). It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)
* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).
* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).
* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//goo.gl/QJTiaF).

#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)

For an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).

* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).
* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons on titles or overusing them in comments.
* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.
* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.
* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.
* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: 
 - 6.1: Content that is unrelated, especially unoriginal, low quality, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys).
 - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.
 - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.
 - 6.4: Reaction images/gifs (unless very high-effort/especially original).
 - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).
 - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.
* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.
* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.
* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.
* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of ""peasantry,"" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When we do giveaways we do it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but **don't mandate** subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Even if you do a giveaway on the subreddit, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).

# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. As the minimum age for Reddit access is [13 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7h5xr7/is_there_a_age_limit_for_reddit/dqodxmb), posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed.|
|2. No memes, and no HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, or DAE posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. Non-memetic image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [KarmaDecay](http://www.karmadecay.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, no hate speech, no harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|
|6. No forbidden titles. (See below.)|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as ""I got banned from \/r/\_\_\_"" or ""This got removed from \/r/\_\_\_"" are not allowed.|
|7. No gore, pornography, or sexually graphic images.|Try /r/NSFWfunny. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|
|8. Do not rehost or hotlink webcomics.|If you are not the author of the comic in question, you may only submit links to the page where it is hosted. Webcomic authors may [request verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/comicauthor) from the moderators, after which they may rehost their own work.|
|9. No pictures of just text.|Submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with irrelevant images that don't add context and transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots). Make a self post instead. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2cPuY8C.jpg)|
|10. No SMS or social media content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, or any other form of ""comments section"" on the Internet, as well as [images accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed. Please view [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) for suggestions of where these submissions can be offered.|

|What do I do if I see a post that breaks the rules?|Click on the report button, and [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the comments of the post.|
|What should I do if I don't see my post in the new queue?|If your submission isn't showing up, please don't just delete it as that makes the filter hate you! Instead [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the post. We'll unban it and it should get better. Please allow 10 minutes for the post to appear before messaging moderators|

**RULES**. |              
:--|:--                                  
 I: Follow reddit's standards!|
 II: No hate speech! There is a difference between comedy and outright hate speech, but ironic hate speech is still hate speech. Know the difference or get banned! Posts in question shall be reviewed by the mods. No memes about violent tragedies or anything that could be seen as glorifying violence. Absolutely no school shooter memes. Posts or comments that can be seen as glorifying violence will result in a ban. This also includes (but is not limited to) memes regarding: Deaths, terrorist attacks, rape, sexual assault, pedo, murder, war, bombings, and school shootings. Breaking this rule may result in a permanent ban. We have zero tolerance for this behavior.  |
 III: Don't be a dick! This includes spoilers, don't post spoilers or you will be banned |
 IV: Flair your posts accordingly after submitting them. |
 V: Censor any and all personal information from posts and comments, or it will be removed. Real or fake! Yours or others! Just don't do it.|
 VI: No spam, outside links, or videos. r/dankmemes is strictly for memes. Post videos (or anything using v.redd.it) to r/dankvideos. Gifs must be well under 10 seconds long. **This is not a platform to advertise your social media network.** If you can't grow it organically, it probably isn't very good anyways. Linking to your instagram or twitter, or spamming links with it watermarked can result in a ban // **No queue flooding - Limit yourself to 5 posts per day** |  
 VII: No asking for up/down votes, comments or reposts in any way, shape, or form! No exceptions. This includes petitions. |
 VIII: Do not encourage or participate in brigading of any subreddits or of any users of Reddit or elsewhere, in any way, shape, or form! This is very against Reddit rules; action will be taken. | 
 IX: Keep it dank! This sub is for humor (and the dankest of memes)! | 
 X: If a post has graphic content, flair it as NSFW, else it will be removed! | 
 XI: NO REEEEEEE-POSTS! This includes reposting your own posts! As a rule of thumb, if it has been posted elsewhere, it's probably been posted here already. Check with Karma Decay before posting! This includes chain posts. | 
 XII: Don't be a normie. If you post normie trash you could be banned! This includes, but is not limited to, Impact font (and fonts which look like Impact), minions, advice animals, rage comics, and the B emoji.|
 XIII: No posts where the title is the meme caption. The caption *must* be in the meme image, not in the submission title. (Basically, if the image makes sense to us by itself, it's fine. If the image requires the submission title for it to make sense, we remove it.) |
 XIV: Direct links only! No albums or landing pages. |

**We reserve the right to remove posts and potentially ban for any reason**

**Welcome to /r/art!** *This is a community of art lovers that share their favorite pieces, or news and information that will impact the art community. Review the subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/wiki/index) before posting or commenting.*



#**Title Formatting Guidelines:**

Titles should be **to the point;** all extra information or context should be added in the comments. **Digital Art posts should include the pixel dimensions of the image uploaded**



> **Your artwork** - *Title, Medium, Size*

> Example 1: *Still life, digital, 800x600 px*

> Example 2: *Still life, pencils, 10x22""*

> **Another artist's work** - *Title, Artist, Medium, Year*

> Example: *The Night Watch, Rembrandt, Oils, 1642*

> **News article** - *Title, Year*

> **Discussion** - make it a self post. Expand on your question in the text and include image examples when possible.

> **Videos** - Videos should be titled in a way consistent with it's content. Videos must be in the gif format. Both art and news are allowed.

#Please flair your post. 


#**Subreddit Rules:**

Rules | Notes
---|---
**1. Use the correct title formatting.** | The title formatting is outlined above. Make sure to follow it or else your post will be removed. Do not add any extraneous information or be subjective in your title. Plagiarism is grounds for a permaban.
**2. Direct image links only.** | All submissions other than articles must be a direct link to a static image or gif (url must end in .jpg, .png, .gif etc.). Articles must contain more substance than just a gallery of images or an embedded video, and they must cover some current news in the art world. The image should only contain 1 art piece.
**3. Do not make multiple posts.** | You must wait at least 48 hours between posts. Please use the rolling sticky for daily challenge posts.
**4. Do not submit sketches, doodles or unfinished work.** |  Post these to other subreddits like /r/IDAP, /r/sketches and /r/doodles instead. If it's an unfinished work and you need advice, post it as a self post.  
**5. Do not submit work with extraneous objects in the frame.** | We're here to look at art, not your Prismacolor pencils, the desk you framed your painting over, your easel, or anything else that would not be seen if the art were publicly displayed.
**6. Do not post memes or other low quality work** | Melted crayon ""art"" and bad MSPaint drawings are subject to a 3 day ban. This rule is totally up to mod discretion.
**7. No fan art, comics, or requests for work.** | [See here.](/r/art/wiki/fan_art) Submissions that don't fit here may be redirected to more suitable subreddits like /r/fanart, /r/artporn, or /r/comics. Requests for art work should be submitted to /r/designjobs instead.
**8. Be respectful and stay on topic** | Bigotry, slapfights, and off topic comments will not be tolerated and may result in all parties being banned.   
**9. Do not include links to blogs, social media, or stores.** | /r/art is not a place to sell your work or grow your following. Consider /r/artstore. This applies to comments and submissions. It applies to watermarks on images as well. Also [see here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) if you're using reddit for self promotion. 
**★ Feel free to add user flair!** | Please edit your flair to tell us your qualifications or specialty, but [follow the guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/vqrvc/introducing_flair_for_rart/). Using non /r/art related flair, or flair that includes social media handles, websites, store information, or otherwise violates our self promotion rules will result in a ban.
**★ If your post doesn't show up...** | it may have been caught in the spam filter. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FArt) and we'll be happy to look into it. 
**★ If you see any rule-breaking posts or comments...** | please report them by clicking the ""report"" button or messaging the moderators directly [here.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FArt)

##[The Announcements Saga](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/saga)
*****
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

##Rules:

##1. No karma-related posts or posts asking for karma.

##2. No threatening or harassing other users.

##3. Posts must be memes related to the Star Wars Prequels.

##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.

##5. No politics.

##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.

##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.

##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.

*****

##Details: 

1. No upvote/karma related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban.

2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc.

3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. ""Prequel"" refers to anything that takes place before A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas and EU content. This also includes Ewan McGregor posts, as they must be related to the prequels instead of just the actor (example: ""Literally a picture of Ewan McGregor"" is not allowed)

4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother.

5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts about politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics.

6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. 

7. Brigading/Encouraging to brigade other subs (telling other users to downvote and raid another sub's content) will result in a permanent ban. This is against Reddit's Terms of Service, and is not tolerated here at all.

8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods.

**Does your post qualify for /r/MildlyInteresting? Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**

-----
> ### 1. No memes 
> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. ""banana for scale,"" ""potato quality"").

----- 

> ### 2. No related posts
> Posts that acknowledge, ""one-up,"" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. ""I see your X and raise you Y"")

-----

> ###3. No x-posts or reposts
> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.

> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. 

----- 

> ###4. Original [OC] photographs only
> **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  

> **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  

> **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.

> **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.

-----

> ###5. No screenshots

> No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. 

-----

> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content
> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  

> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a ""spoiler"" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!

> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )

> *Still confused? For more elaboration and examples, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/) first and then [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) if you still have questions.*

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

33x33,t5_33x33,BlackPeopleTwitter,"**Screenshots of Black people being hilarious or insightful on social media, it doesn't need to just be twitter but obviously that is best.**

Black culture has a unique way of examining the everyday and we are here to showcase that.

---

RULES

1.) **Do not post content just because a black person posted it.** This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people.

-    1. **No original content.** We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just  for     this subreddit.
  


2.) No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/).
 
3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
 
4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.
 
5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).

6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.

7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.

8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add ""bruh"", ""fam"", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.

9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking ""what does x mean?"" will be removed. 


10.) Don't call out people as white. People of all colors do post and comment here. It contributes nothing to the conversation and is punishable by ban.
 
11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  

12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**

##About:

A subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public. Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.

>Saturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.

##Rules:

0. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.

1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage or call for witch-hunts

2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders

3. Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)

4. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban

5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]

6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making making a post of that nature.

7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.

8.  ~~Submissions from videogurr.com are banned and will be removed.~~ (This rule no longer applies, but may be re-instated in the future.)

9. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).

10. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.

[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.

**[Repost]** - While they have their place, avoid making these submissions consistently

**[Follow Up]**- A news article or other report which follows up on a video that was previously posted to the subreddit. Please include a link to the original freakout if possible. 

**[Protest Freakout]** - Videos of Protests and the Freakouts that occur during the protest.

**[Compilation]** - A compilation of freakouts

**[Possibly Fake]** - Might have been staged

##Avoid:

#Posting rules#
 
1. **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
 
1. **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g ""TIL xyz is a great movie"").

1. **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.

   1. *""TIL about ..."" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word ""about"").*
   1. *""TIL how to ..."" posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**

##Rules

Rule name | Description
---|---
**Rule 1: Detail Guidelines** | Not blatantly obvious observations, but obscure enough that people could have missed it, or they noticed it but the significance didn’t click. Doesn’t need to be intentional. Obviously, obscurity is subjective and that is taken into account when moderating. **Use the ""Detail"" flair for these posts.**  
**Rule 2: Flair your post.** | This includes the “Verified” flair (claiming the creators meant for it), “Easter Egg” (a hidden gem that was meant to go unnoticed), and “Trivia” (obscure facts that are otherwise unimportant). If your post makes any of these claims, the right flair is needed and you must provide proof in the comments or the text of the post, otherwise it may be reflaired “Detail.”
**Rule 3: Comment rules. (hover for details)** | Be civil. Uncivil comments including ""detail is obvious"" will be removed and may get you banned. Political comments may be removed because they can easily devolve into off-topic arguments.
**Rule 4: Titles must include the movie name.** | All submissions **must** include the name of the movie in the title.
**Rule 5: Explain your post.** | Make sure your submission has an explanation either in the title or in the comments and add ""(explanation in comments)"" to your title.
**Rule 6: No recent movies or spoilers in titles.** | No spoilers in the title or untagged comments. Don't browse [/new](/r/moviedetails/new) if you're worried about this. Until a movie receives recognized release (via Physical Media/Digital Demand), it's not eligible for /r/MovieDetails.
**Rule 7: No games or TV shows, movies only.** | Submissions must be movies, TV shows, and games should go to /r/TVDetails and /r/GamingDetails. See [this multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/bobcobble/m/mediadetails/) for more details subreddits.
**Rule 8: No offtopic posts.** | No memes, meta or request posts.
**Rule 9: Avoid reposts.** | No [common reposts](/r/moviedetails/w/common_details), recent reposts or reposts from the [top 200](/r/MovieDetails/top/?t=all).

##Notes
* All submissions should be in English.

* No repost farming. This is usually users who mass repost submissions that just about don't break our repost rule. We may ban users who do this.

* If a post or comment breaks the rules, please don't just complain. Hit the report button and we'll look into it ASAP :).

* Appeals to bans or post removals should be sent via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieDetails). 

* NSFW content is allowed but must be distinguished as such.

* Intentionally spoiling content may lead to a ban.

* Reposting removed content will result in a ban. 

* Bots or bot-like behaviour isn't allowed. Unless a bot is approved by the mods they will be banned.

This is a subreddit for memes and discussions about about Special Counsel Robert Mueller III, and his ongoing investigation of the Trump administration's ties to Russia. 

Rules:

1. Stick to memes and shitposts when submitting shit. This is meant to be a silly subreddit, sorta like /r/Circlejerk or any of the other meme subs. Don't get your knickers in a twist over a silly meme. If you want proper discussion about the investigation, check out /r/RussiaLago. Articles are acceptable too.

2. Don't be a dick. This includes racism, sexism, general bigotry, etc., as well as other assorted personal insults. If you're a dick once, your comment will just get removed. If you're repeatedly dickish, then you will get banned (The level of dickishness that will warrant a ban is up to the discretion of the moderators).

3. Upvote begging and other extremely low-quality posts are now banned. If your submission says *upvote if* or any permutation of that, it will be removed and you will be asked to resubmit with a different title.

4. Brigading attempts, incoming or outgoing are forbidden. Do not troll this subreddit, do not incite others to troll other subreddits. 

5. Obvious trolling, self-promotion and other spam will be removed and can get you banned. If you wish to promote something please ask Modmail for approval.

Also; Trump supporters won't be banned on sight. Unlike a certain similarly named subreddit, dissent *is* tolerated. Just don't break the rules in your dissenting.

**Be cautious of any unusual private messages containing a link offering to share ""private"" photos with you from unknown, new or unverified users.**

**DID SOMEONE FIND YOUR FACEBOOK? It's a joke/trick link. Don't give them more contact info. Report/block them!**

## Rules
- **Read the FAQ before commenting or posting**. This sidebar is the TL;DR, but you're still obligated to follow the guidelines and the general spirit of the FAQ.

- **Report any comments or threads you find abusive**. We check the reported queue often. If you come across a user being mean spirited or posting personal info, click the report link. When you argue with a troll, you are entering a competition to see who has more free time. You will lose, because you have a life and the troll does not. **Do not EVER respond to trolls. Instead, report them!**

- **Be respectful**. Don't insult the ones brave enough to submit photos / videos. If you don't want to see dicks then don't open the ones with the [male] tag... it'll likely be dicks.

- Don't make creepy, threatening, or malicious comments. Don't be an asshole or crash our party with your drama. **Respect the anonymity of our users or be banned**. If you link to another user's personal info / content outside reddit--if you so much as try to guess a name--you will be shown the door.

- The Reddit spam filter sometimes mistakenly nabs perfectly genuine non-spam posts. If you think a submission of yours or someone else has been filtered, please contact the moderators.

- **Please add a [m]ale or [f]emale tag in the title of your submission(s).** Feel free to be creative and play with this tag. A [CD] (cross dresser) tag, [t] (transgender) tag, or simply a [?] are also admissible, with the understanding that if someone clicks on a [?] they don't mind a surprise. :)

- Do not post, comment, or otherwise request off-site contact (snapchat, kik, tumblr, twitter, etc.) here or on your profile page

**If you sell panties, fetish items, cam shows, or anything similar, and wish to post to Gonewild, please do so under a separate account**. We wish to remain separated from all money-making endeavors, so that Gonewild remains a purely exhibitionists subreddit where people post for absolutely no other reason than the thrill of it.

We want to foster safe, mature, low-pressure environment for true exhibitionists that are out for nothing other than to show off their naked bodies. **We don't explicitly state everything that is and is not allowed, so please don't try to skirt the rules**. Thank you!

3deqz,t5_3deqz,BikiniBottomTwitter,"Welcome to /r/BikiniBottomTwitter, a place to share all of your favorite memes from our favorite underwater residence, Bikini Bottom! 

Bikini Bottom has a unique way of examining the everyday and we're here to showcase that. Whether it's hilarious, wholesome, depressing, or surreal, Bikini Bottom offers relatable commentary that we all can enjoy. If you can't respect that then please take a bus to Rock Bottom.

Special thanks to u/BayonettaBasher!

###THE RULES

* **1. Do not post content just because it features a resident of Bikini Bottom.**
If you want a sub catered to that sort of thing, check out r/Spongebob. As for here, *this is for memes and for memes only.*

* **2. Don't be a dick.**
No racism against squirrels. No hate speech. No posts about how different Pearl is from her father.

* **3. Do not put the punchline in the title of the post.**
 Having a funny picture of a Bikini Bottom resident and using the title as the punchline *does not make your post a meme.*

* **4. Do not post *really* low-effort memes.**
Using excessively overdone and/or outdated templates, posting something that is excruciatingly unfunny, posting something that simply doesn't make any sense... you get the idea.

* **5. ABSOLUTELY NO REPOSTS.**
[Use this nifty little tool to determine whether or not your post has already been here.](https://reverse.photos/)

* **6. The mods reserve the right to take any action (which includes banning users and removing comments) that they feel improves the overall quality of this subreddit.**
Our most basic duty as mods is to keep this sub clean of any bullshit. With that in mind, we will do whatever we have to do in order to uphold that responsibility. How's that for a little transparency?

1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the gif).  **[Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/RXihRpT.png)**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.

2qh0s,t5_2qh0s,comics,"##About \/r/Comics

> This subreddit is for everything related to print comics and web comics.  Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.


##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)

> 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.
2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit.
3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.
4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.
5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. 
6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  

##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)

> * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.
* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.
* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  
* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.
* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.

##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)

> * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to ""fix"" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.
* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.
* **Don't put the punchline in the post title** - Links to humor comics that are submitted with joke-ruining titles may be removed.  
* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.
* **Shitposts** --  Low-effort stick-figure/MS Paint drawing/meme or other lazy/meta/circlejerk content is not welcome. Don't post rage comics, non-comic memes, or CAPTCHAs

##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)

> Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their ""Original Content."" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.

The most important rule is **Just Post**. If you've never had a post or comment removed it means you haven't been posting enough.

Our unique rule is that **all posts need to be titled ""me irl""**. Posts that aren't are automatically removed. 

We do not allow posts that reference suicide. This community is not equipped to handle this topic. If you are feeling suicidal [we have some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.

**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.

**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!

**Don't make posts that request upvotes** or any other kind of reddit metric (gold, comments, etc.). That age of me irl is over.

#Taste

#But

#Great

#Execution

Follow us on Twitter @ATBGE

For everything that displays quality craftsmanship in the least elegant way possible. All things gaudy, tacky, overdone, and otherwise tasteless. Work done so well, you won't know whether to love it or hate it.


#Rule 1: Must be great execution

All posts must exhibit great execution; quality craftsmanship is a must. Posts will be removed if they do not meet this standard.

Content that will always be removed:

 * Music Videos
 * Car Wraps

#Rule 2: NSFW

This is a SFW subreddit so all sexual posts must be tagged as NSFW, if your title includes sexual body parts that is a good sign it needs a tag. Repeatedly posting without a tag will result in a ban.

#Rule 3: Reposting

Links that are in the top 200 all time or have been post in the last 30 days are not allowed. When reporting a repost please use the other field and include a link to the original post.

#Rule 4: Follow [Reddiquette] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) 

Please treat other redditors with respect and class. The moderators thank you in advance. Violations of reddiquette may be met with a ban.

#Rule 5: No Screen Shots
Screen shots of text, social media or sale websites are not allowed. This sub is about the merit of the craftsmanship and the terrible taste not captions or social media comments. If your submission includes text, comments or sales information please re-host just the photo and resubmit.

#Rule 6: No Photoshop
Computer generated renderings or photoshopped submissions are not allowed. As an example no photoshopped wraps.

#Rule 7: Awful Taste

Posts that are cute, funny, unique, or otherwise tasteful will be removed. Taste is highly subjective, so use your best judgement. Just because it is a tattoo does not mean it is awful taste. Do not post something you made or own.

---
We are mitigating the amount of posts that link directly to other works of art by a creator or owner. All direct links to these posts will be removed. We are trying to limit the amount of negative comment traffic and downvotes directed towards other subreddits (taste is a subjective thing, after all). Violations can result in a ban. Cross posts of non-author/owner work are still allowed.

---
The mods of /r/ATBGE reserve the ability to remove a post that does not explicitly violate the rules of the subreddit but does not fit the spirit of the subreddit. ",760032,False

#**Welcome to /r/Memes**

---

**definition of a meme / memetics**

- a way of describing cultural information being shared.
- an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.
- Please note, Moderators reserve the right to remove any post for ***any*** reason. 

---

#Rules:

1. All posts must be memes. No titles as meme captions. No memes that are only text. **Someone saying something funny on twitter is not a meme.** 

1. Please make posts general rather than specific personal experiences. This helps make posts more relatable.     
_This means no selfies, SMS screenshots, personal stories, chats, emails, etc. **Do not post ""memes"" of you or your friends IRL. No creepshots either.** 

1. Do not spam this sub. Linking to your instagram or twitter, or spamming links with it watermarked can result in a ban // **No Chainposting** // **Images of being banned or having a post removed from another subreddit will be removed and subject to ban**

1. Please do not troll, harass, or be generally rude to your fellow users. Keep comments civil and be respectful of your fellow users. Don't post racist or bigoted memes. Those belong elsewhere.

1. Please do not post or request personal information, yours or others'. 

1. Please link to images directly. **No videos/GIFs.** Direct links make browsing easier for those using RES or through a mobile device.

1. Please **do not mention upvotes/downvotes/cake days/karma in your post in any form.** No ""Upvote in..."" or ""Upvote if..."" type titles or memes. **No memes about votes, likes etc.** No petitions.

1. Please avoid re-posting memes. We want original content. Serial reposters may be banned. 

1. No forced memes, pushing agendas, or bad titles. Be creative but memes must come naturally. If you write a bot to spam this subreddit without discussion with the mods, you will be banned. We are not here to grow your instagram account, memes with watermarks will be removed.

1. No memes about violent tragedies or anything that could be seen as glorifying violence. Absolutely no school shooter memes. Posts or comments that can be seen as glorifying violence will result in a ban. This also includes (but is not limited to) memes regarding: Deaths, terrorist attacks, rape, sexual assault, pedo, murder, war, bombings, and school shootings. Breaking this rule may result in a permanent ban. We have zero tolerance for this behavior.

1. No memes about politics. Absurd memes featuring politicians are allowed, but this sub does not allow content more suited for /r/politicalhumor. No NPC memes, or memes about how libtards or magats are so wrong. Take it somewhere else, thanks.

#Queue flooding is not allowed in this subreddit. Limit your posts to five or less per day

A place for the shittiest, most mocking ""pro-tips"" you can think of.  Whether you want to let us know how glue can help out your hair or the quickest way to clog a public toilet, we're the place to post.

If your post does not appear in the new tab after several minutes, it may have been caught by our spam filter.  If this happens, send a message to the mods and we'll get it fixed up for you!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**WHAT IS A LIFE PRO TIP?**
A Life Pro Tip (or LPT) is a tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Rules:**

1. The post must contain a  life pro tip that is **shitty**.  This isn't a dumping ground for shitty statements.  Any tips that are actual good advice will be removed at the discretion of the mod team.  What constitutes shitty is hard to explain, but much like porn, we know it when we see it. 
2. We will remove all posts with the tip ""Kill Yourself"" or any variation thereof.  Not because we don't want you to kill yourself (we do), but we have seen every single combination of this tip, and are sick of them.  They aren't original.

2. Circlejerking is lame too.  Simply copying a popular post from here, or LPT and putting a minor twist to it so it's ""shitty"" is also unoriginal, and we will probably remove those too if we see them. Also, posting the same ""SLPT: repost for more karma!"" image is bad and if you do that, you are a bad person. In fact, let's make an attempt to not repost at all, let's make our ancestors proud, mkay?

1.  **Finally, If you act like a racist, spammer, or are being a general douchenozzle, the mods reserve the right to ban your ass without warning.**

_____________________________________

**Note: For God's sake this subreddit is meant to be taken in a joking, satirical manner.  Please don't actually follow any of this advice, and don't report posts as inciting violence.  You should know this already, but some of you forget which sub you are in when you report.**

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://goo.gl/33lRej)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/offbeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be ""Oniony"". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://goo.gl/nBJ8Do).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

2xhvq,t5_2xhvq,AmItheAsshole,"**Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole!**

[](http://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole)

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. 

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  

#[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)
___

#Rules

**1. Be Civil**

The title of this sub is not an invitation for you to be cruel. The purpose of this space is to determine whether or not someone is in the wrong, not to tear them a new one. People post here to learn and to grow from what they learn here. Don't be an asshole when making your judgments. Treat others with respect, no matter how big of an asshole they may be.

This rule applies to everyone mentioned in a post and to other users. Don't get into prolonged internet spats that devolve into insults.

**2. Post Must Start With AITA**

The TITLE of your submission must begin with AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Meta posts require moderator approval and the TITLE must start with META, if your Meta post starts with AITA it won't be & you will be banned. Updates also require mod approval and the TITLE must start with UPDATE. Updates will NOT be approved for recent posts.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise.

**3. Accept Your Judgment**

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject...accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

**4. Never Delete An Active Discussion**

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. This sub is meant to start discussions that people will want to check back in on to see what consensus was reached. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. **We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy**, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

**5. No Violence**

If your post involves violence, don't bother. Threads about violence are difficult to moderate, because we are supposed to remove comments which encourage or incite violence. It's very difficult to do this in a thread where the main focus is violence.

We enforce the no violence policy very strictly. Even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" or anything that wishes excessive mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited.

**6. Voting Rules**

Upvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.

In the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you, or merely for commenting on their own post, unless they are being abusive or argumentative.

**7. User Flairs**

If a community member distinguishes themselves in their innate ability to judge people on their assholliness, they will be awarded a flair. These flairs, and their respective Top Voted Comment prerequisites, are:

Rank Name | # of Top Voted Comments
---|---
Partassipant | 1
Asshole Enthusiast | 3 
Asshole Aficionado | 10
Certified Proctologist | 20 
Colo-rectal Surgeon | 40 
Supreme Court Just-ass | 60 
Commander-in-Cheeks | 100
Judge, Jury, Excretioner | 200

If you think you have all the requirements to obtain a flair and our bot hasn't done it for you automatically, message the mods with links to the posts, and we'll assign it when it's verified!

**8. Comments & Post Flairs** 

After 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. **The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post.** OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period. 

If you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e. 

**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 

**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

**9. What Posts Belong Here?**

Submissions should be TRUTHFUL descriptions of recent conflicts you've had or may have that need arbitration. Describe both sides in detail. Being neutral gets you more accurate feedback.

Don't submit humblebrag stories where there is no chance that you are the asshole, or awfulbrag stories where you are obviously being evil.

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed.

**10. Meta Posts Require Permission**

More of a clarification than a rule. If you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned.

Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META. Please request mod approval after you submit your META.

####Welcome to /r/EarthPorn, reddit's premiere landscape photography subreddit. 

[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

######Please post your own images here, but before you do, kindly read and adhere to the following rules:

###### **Rules:**
Submissions must be:

###### A photograph.
No Paintings, illustrations, gifs, videos, or interactive images.

###### A photograph you took (OC) 
or one which you can provide the [original source for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_this_is_my_first_time_submitting.2C_what_should_i_know.3F) Do not rehost non-OC images to reddit or imgur. Failure to provide the photographers name or the original source of the image can result in a ban. 

###### A single image
Albums may be posted in the comments.
Panoramas, Image Stacks, Composites, and images edited via Photoshop or similar software are allowed.

###### An image featuring a natural landscape
Images with humans, machines, boats, roads, airplanes, farms, animals, buildings, or other man made objects in them [will be removed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_what_types_of_images_are_allowed.3F)

###### An unsilhouetted image
Images where details in the landscape are not visible due to silhouetting will be removed.

###### No photos taken illegally
This includes flying your drone in a no-fly zone. Please respect local laws and access closures!


###### **Title Requirements:**
You submission title must contain the following:

###### The location of the area in the photo.
When it comes to location, the more specific the better. If you wish to not disclose the location you should at the very least name the state/country. Rule of thumb for naming only the location (e.g. a lake, mountain): if one can find the place immediately by searching it in google it's fine. For possibly ambiguous locations add state/country for safety.

###### The resolution of the image in pixel format.
For example, an image taken on an iPhone 6 would have a resolution of [3264x2448]

###### The photographers name.
If you took the photo use [OC]. OC submitters will be reward with different camera flairs based on number of OC submissions.

###### Do not include your device name in the title.
Feel free to add photography details such as camera, lens, and settings, as a comment.

###### Do not ask for upvotes in your title.
A complete list of subreddit rules are found in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index)

---

###### **Comment Rules:**

Hate Speech, Abusive remarks, homophobia, and the like have no place on this subreddit, and will be removed on sight.

Please contribute to the discussion positively; if you don't like a picture and you wish to voice your opinion please refrain from abusing the photographer/submitter.

---

###### **Other important rules:**

EarthPorn is not a catch-all subreddit. Images that are submitted here are individually reviewed for compliance with our subreddit rules. If your submission is removed, a moderator should advise which of our network of SFWPorn subreddits would be a more appropriate place to submit.

* Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to ""fix"" the colors of an image or remove a watermark.
* Non-OC submissions are restricted to [one per day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2pd9kj/a_small_rule_change_for_earthporn/)**
* Regarding reposts: it is only a repost if it was posted to /r/EarthPorn less than three months ago, or if it is already in the [top100 of all time.](/r/EarthPorn/top/)
* Circlejerky/sandbagging/pandering titles may be removed.
* If you have any questions check out the [**wiki**](/r/EarthPorn/wiki/).
* Breaking multiple rules will result in a ban.

**Some examples of what we're looking for**:  
  
Mammals have a really [**good memory**](http://i.imgur.com/8HDxmVu.gifv)  
Some orangutans [**learn**](http://i.imgur.com/dyOHnH9.jpg) how to [**fish**](http://i.imgur.com/Z8jumVo.jpg)  
This dog [**knows**](http://i.imgur.com/DT0UoMO.gif) he's at the vet  
  
Having such good memories means they remember their suffering.  
For instance, these cows are [**happy**](http://i.imgur.com/o8pQgWc.gif) for returning to the pasture after a long winter.   
  
Emotionally mammals are very developed, like us.  
They share with us many of our feelings, such as [**fear**](http://i.imgur.com/OLD9y5c.gif) and [**love**](http://i.imgur.com/aBdMCRI.gif).   
  
Their emotions can be every bit as troubling as ours.  
They can be [**depressed**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/26/depressed-goat_n_5391433.html) so much they won't even eat!   
  
Even our distant relatives, the cetaceans are [**very aware**](http://i.imgur.com/60bpRcT.gif) and very [**playful**](http://i.imgur.com/U8S5Nay.gif) fellows.   
This Humpback Whale, for instance, realizes she's been saved from a fishing net and lets her rescuers know she is [**thankful**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcXU7G6zhjU#t=361).
    
Non-mammal animals on the other hand appear to be quite different from us, but birds always find ways to [**puzzle us**](https://i.imgur.com/FFvYq6T.gif).  
Apparently they [**like to have fun**](http://i.imgur.com/6bjK663.gif)!  
The [**crow**](http://tinyurl.com/8347c8q) is probably the [**smartest**](http://i.imgur.com/9LSIZjs.gif) bird there is!   
  
Birds in general are very [**aware**](http://i.imgur.com/tTbAnPI.gif) of what their peers are doing.     
  
Evidence is [**everywhere**](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness)... yet no one seems to care[...](https://www.reddit.com/r/likeus/comments/44am4c/boy_are_his_arms_tired/czwzlzi)  
  
Everytime you find evidence remember to share with us. 
  
Thanks for tuning in to the sub ;)

---
###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#0. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#1. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#3. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#4. No Porn or Gore

* There are many other subreddits for such content. 

#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#6. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#8. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.

###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos#mods)

#Removals & Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.


#Submit Feedback

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed.

#CONTENT POLICY

This subreddit is **moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low quality, low effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. **We do not ""let the votes decide""**. We understand that this type of policy is controversial and uncommon, especially for default subreddits, but we believe this method of moderation gives a subreddit the best chance at maintaining quality.

#[THE RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/rules)

Rules are enforced upon moderator discretion. 

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. IT MUST BE CRAPPY DESIGN|Every submission must be a Crappy Design. If your post seems more appropriate in the following subreddits, please post there instead. /r/Engrish - for translations gone wrong, /r/SoftwareGore or /r/technope - for programming errors.|
|2. NO RECENT, TOP 100, OR COMMON REPOSTS| New content is encouraged. Reposts of content under three months old or in the [top 100 posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/top/?sort=top&t=all) will be removed, along with [common reposts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/common_reposts). Other reposts may be removed at moderator discretion.
|3. KEEP QUALITY HIGH| Software problems, swastikas, and penises may be removed at moderator discretion. Mugs and T-shirts will likely also be removed.
|4. NO PERSONAL INFORMATION| Posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information (real/fake) will result in a ban without prior warning. This includes, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, or any social media accounts, regardless if it is your own.
|5. BE CIVIL - NO SWEAR WORDS|All users are expected to be respectful to others. Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, otherwise inappropriate behavior or content, comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed. Violators may be banned.
|6. TITLES SHOULD DESCRIBE AND REPRESENT THE CONTENT|Try to come up with titles that are descriptive. If the crappy design is not obvious in the photo, please describe it. Posts like, ""...,"" ""this,"" ""hmmmmm,"" ""um,"" ""oof,"" etc. will be removed. Also, titles with just emojis (no text) will be removed.

Welcome to the hub of Food on reddit!

# **We have a few rules here, please take a moment to make yourself aware of them. Please see the [WIKI LINK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/wiki/index) for complete and updated rules** We expect every user to follow [reddit main rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) above all and included with sub rules. If your content is removed, please send a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffood) and do NOT send the mods a message to their personal inbox. 

####**If you are banned, please [check here first](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/wiki/autoban)**


**Recipes are not required but are heavily encouraged** Please be kind and provide one. A recipe consists of a list of ingredients and directions, not just a link to a domain. 

[EXAMPLE 1 OF PREFERRED RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/73hzyj/homemade_glazed_donuts_might_not_look_like_much/dnqygp0/) 

[EXAMPLE 2 OF PREFERRED RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/6zjvc1/homemade_chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_fudge/dmwe91f/)

**NEW USERS** 

* **New users accounts are filtered. There is a small threshold of karma and age requirement before being allowed to post freely. Send us a link to your post for approval. This is usually done once per account. Beyond that, we request that you build up your karma before posting again.**

1.  **Be nice to each other.** We enforce reddiquete as a rule here. [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) Do not call other user's food shit, nasty, disgusting, etc. Don't like it? Move along. There are tens of thousands more images to choose from.  

2. **Only food-related posts and comments are allowed.** We are an OC sub and prefer users not repost. Do not post in response to other posts, including separate posts of the same dish/meal, or to inflame. No sexual crudeness, crude talk about feces, bowel movements, etc ( sheesh, we really have to explain this??). No comments, like diabetes, diabeetus, etc. No memes or social media anywhere, including IG, FB, twitter, etc. 2 posts per 24 hours, per user. **Most YOUTUBE LINKS  ARE NOT ALLOWED** Video links in the comments are heavily scrutinized, must be solely relevant to the food and must abide by the self promotion/spam guidelines, whatever the source. We only allow official YT channels, celebrity chef cooking channels and otherwise approved channels **(minimum 200K subscribers)**. No surveys, links to surveys, Kickstarter mentions or asking for help with research classes, including requests for money.

3. **We do not allow blogs, at all, in any form.** This rule includes posts or comments, links embedded in imgur descriptions, watermarks on images, linking to blog sites, including wordpress and blogspot, any other form of redirect links, MOST EVERY SINGLE domain in addition to any excessive self promotion. Domains are heavily moderated. Do not post domain links unless approved. 

4. **Use np.reddit.com links when linking to other subs or to this one.** 

5. **Please make your titles descriptive and just about the food.** Posts with titles that do not describe the link contents will be removed without notice. **We remove posts with titles that tell a backstory. DO NOT post the price or location, who, where, when or how.** We allow titles that describe the food, just the food and nothing but the food. **If you are going to post a compilation album, you must describe the first three dishes.** Avoid all caps. Avoid phrases like "" my first"", ""from scratch"", ""first attempt"" Do not title food as vegan/vegetarian/keto/GF, use the flair instead. [See the wiki for details](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/wiki/index)

6. **Post tags are required for images** Use **only one** of the following tags for Link posts:  [Homemade], [I ate], [Pro/Chef], [Found] ,[Request/Discussion] ,[Misc]. If you have questions on what they mean, message the mods. Please mind the 4/1 [found] ratios, for non-OC images.

7. **No politics. No dietary activism.** We are a general food sub and do not endorse any dietary regimen over another. We do not allow users to promote their dietary lifestyles or anything politically related here. There are other subs for that. 

8. **No shit posting.** This includes crossposts to /r/wewantplates and other shitty subs. Karmawhores will be dealt with swiftly. 


***If you see a violation of these rules, report it.** We will act swiftly.

>2. Provide source if there is one. We won't go hunting you down, but at least be considerate of the creator.

>3. Your title must be informative of what is going on in the gif, instead of the good ole ""Look at this gem"" or ""Just a wheel"". They can be funny, but just consider this.

/r/technology is a place to share and discuss the latest developments, happenings and curiosities in the world of technology; a broad spectrum of conversation as to the innovations, aspirations, applications and machinations that define our age and shape our future. 

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport%26sort%3Dnew%26author%3AAutoModerator%7Cveritanuda&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. 

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote,  which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 

##4. Flair

* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).

##5. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not post personal information; no facebook or social media links. Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). 

* Removed threads will either be given a removal reason flair or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.

* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time. 

* Rule violators will be warned. Repeat offenders will be temporarily banned from one to seven days. An unheeded final warning will result in a permanent ban. This may be reversed upon evidence of suitable behavior.

###4. No Low Effort Posts

###**Rules** ([Detailed Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/wiki/rules))

#1. **Comments and discussions must remain civil or they will be removed.** 
 - Follow proper [**reddiquette.**](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)
 - This subreddit is about a video game; keep political discussion to other, more appropriate subreddits. This is not the place for heated console debates.
 - Due to the nature of Red Dead Redemption and its M-rating, M-rated language and content is allowed, within reason. However, this does not mean things like insults and personal attacks are allowed.

#2. **NO SPOILING RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 WITHOUT THE USE OF THE SPOILER TAG.**  
 - Use spoiler syntax:`>!RDR is a great game!<` will become >!RDR is a great game!<
 - Comment spoiler syntax DOES NOT work for some mobile users. Everyone still must use spoiler syntax, but those who browse on mobile web or non-official reddit apps be aware
 - Absolutely no spoilers, intentional or otherwise, in the title of your post.
 - All posts with spoilers INSIDE them must have [Spoilers] or [Spoiler] in the title
 - This will be considered a serious offense and will result in a permanent ban from the subreddit.
 - Unsure whether it's a story spoiler? Mark it as one to be safe. ([Or ask the mods](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddeadredemption))

#3. **All content must be directly related to Red Dead Redemption.** 
 - They must be related by more than just the title. 
 - If you are submitting a meme: unless the image is directly related to Red Dead Redemption, it must be separable from your title and still remain funny.
 - Other memes can be posted on /r/RedDeadMemes
 - LFG Posts belong in /r/RedDeadCrews.

#4. **Low-effort & low-quality content may be removed.**
 - Videos or spam, intrusive or obvious fluff content will be removed.
 - Misleading titles and posts, trying to trick user into clicking your post.
 - Image macros , overused generic meme formats and low effort/common in game screenshots will be removed. Memes must make a genuine attempt at humor. Consider posting to /r/RedDeadMemes.
 - Simple questions should be asked in the daily question thread.
 - Duplicate content will be removed.

#5. **Link to high-quality websites & official sources.**
 - Well-written articles with sources are preferred over fluff articles and evidence-less news/speculation posts. 
 - Websites with excessive ads, agenda-pushing, misleading content or links, etc. may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.
 - Link to official sources such as R*'s official website or social medias. 

#6. **Choose the most relevant link flair.**
 - Incorrect link flair can often be corrected but may result in the removal of your post. 
 - Contact the mod team if you make a mistake.

#7. **Minimize self-promotion.** 
 - Sharing OC is strongly encouraged, and with OC often comes self-promotion. 
 - We ask that you take care to participate in the community beyond self-promotion. 
 - Users who actively engage themselves in the subreddit and make the occasional self-promotional post will be approved. 
 - However, **treating our subreddit solely as a platform for advertisement is not allowed.**

> **Posting Rules**
---
 ---
*Remember: the rules change on weekends! See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*
 ---
1. **No sourcing:** Do not ask for (or give) information on where or how to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, THC, CBD, etc.), or make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics. See reddit’s [content policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions) for more information.
2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.
3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You are allowed to post on /r/saplings instead.
4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are prohibited. This includes all forms of asking for money or other things of value. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).
5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts  about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.
6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. 
7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).
8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism or encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high.)
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  

The /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.

---
#### [](#h4-green)  
> **The /r/Trees Weekend**
---
 ---
####SLACK-POST SATURDAY
 ---
* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).
> 
---
####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

2v2cd,t5_2v2cd,HistoryMemes,"[A History Network Member](http://www.reddit.com/r/historynetwork/#/button/c/red)

This subreddit was created because there was a niche that was not being filled in the historical Reddit community. There was no place to be a redditor in history. All of your historical jokes and memes go here. (This is a place for memes, not propaganda.)

Our Friends (those who promote us are in bold):

* **/r/historyanimemes**
* **/r/animemes**
* **/r/roughromanmemes**
* **/r/redditthroughhistory**
* **/r/shittyaskhistory**
* **/r/Ancient_History_Memes**
* /r/dankmemesfromsite19
* /r/bestBritanniamemes
* /r/dankcrusadememes
* /r/dankprecolumbianmemes
* /r/okbuddyretard
* /r/AustriaHungary
* r/Sabaton
* r/FantasyArtMemes
* /r/Historymemenetwork 

Remember, this is the memes part of the historical community of reddit, not the historical part of the memes community of reddit. Treat it as such.

Rules:

1. **Keep posts history related:**
Please keep all submissions history related and based on actual events, not ideology or other random topics. However, ""Meta"" posts about the subreddit are allowed.
2. **Untagged reposts:** YOU MUST HAVE [REPOST] IN YOUR TITLE. We will no longer be allowing reposts of younger than 4 months, reposts of memes from the Top 100 of all time, or reposts of frequently made posts.
3. **Discrimination and abuse:**
Any excessive sexism, homophobia, racism or any other form of discrimination will be dealt with harshly and mods reserve the right to impose bans without warning. Basically try not to be jerks.
4. **Year limit:**
All post must be of a subject of at least 20 years from the post. Example: 9/11 memes won't be able to be posted till 2021.
5. **""Fake Caption"" Style posts:**
This isn’t r/fakehistoryporn. Don’t post memes that are fake, captioned pictures depicting historical events.
6. **Genocide Denial.**
The Holodomor, Holocaust, and the Armenian Genocide all happened, among others. Don't deny them, you will receive a ban. Hateful historical revisionists aren't welcome.
7. **""Meme Wars"":**
In case of a ""meme war"", do not brigade other subreddits and please abide by their rules when posting there.
8. **No Brigading:**
Directly linking posts to political subreddits is not allowed unless it is linked in a non-participating manner (i.e. linking ""np.reddit.com"" rather than ""www.reddit.com""). For more info see https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro
9. **Reporting:**
If you believe that a submission is violating any of the above rules, please use the report button or message the moderator team. You can also contact us if you have suggestions for improvement or other problems regarding the subreddit.
10. **Low effort Titles and karma whoring**
any post with a low effort title, ""interesting title"", ""[single letter]"", etc will be removed regardless of content. Karma whoring, asking for upvotes in the title or the post in any way, will also be removed without notice by the mod team and you will receive a temporary ban.

# **About Us**

/r/trashy is a *celebration* of trash: people, things, media, etc. that boldly and shamelessly violates social conventions and cultural norms. Satisfy our voyeuristic drives by sharing trashy images, videos, stories, and fashion. All forms of trash are eagerly welcomed.

# Rule 1: **Behave yourself.** 
* Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to Trash^TM are not allowed.
* Bullying is not allowed. 
* Toxic behavior of any kind is banned. 
* To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. Respectful threads on these issues will be tolerated.
* No witch hunts.
* Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

# Rule 2: **Submissions must be appropriate for this subreddit.**
* No images of those whose ""trashiness"" is clearly the result of a serious mental illness.
* No pictures of people in healthcare settings (e.g. doctor's office, hospital, clinic waiting room) that they didn't take and post publicly themselves (aka no doctor's office creepshots).
* No porn unless it is excessively trashy.
* No child abuse or animal abuse. 
* No child porn.
* No fake trash. 
* No pictures of literal trash.
* No gore or death videos and pictures.
* No reposts.
* No license plates.
* Remove all family names / usernames from submissions. Any information that can be used to find the subjects posted here is banned.
* All NSFW posts must be marked NSFW.
* No memes / image macros. This includes social media status updates consisting **solely** of memes / image macros.
* Posts must be Trashy^TM of their own accord, context is helpful but not sufficient to make it Trashy^TM.
* **Please make an effort with your title**.
* All social media posts that do not include a photo **must include the comments**.

* No mass-produced novelty items such as bumper stickers, window decals or commonly posted t-shirt designs. 

* [Trashy Tumblr](https://internetdumpsterfires.tumblr.com/)

***
 [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/2sp32m/rtrashy_has_two_new_rules/) for information regarding  our two new rules.

# **Sidenotes**
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not a post is Trashy^TM. 
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not behavior is excessively toxic. 
* Comment threads with rampant rule breaking will be locked.
* Sexualizing minors will result in an automatic ban.

## Tips:

- These are not the subreddit rules. Please see the guidelines link above.

- If you are posting a help request, please include as many details as possible. Please consider adding photos and doing some basic research into your question. /r/DIY should not be your first stop for your question.  

- All help request must go in ""self posts"" or the stickied thread at the top of the subreddit.

- If you are sharing your finished DIY project, please explain how it was done. Consider putting the finished photo first, however this is not a requirement. Comments regarding finished photo location will be removed. Projects without adequate detail will be removed.

- Please keep all comments on topic. Moderators will remove off-topic comments at their discretion.  

- All images must be hosted on imgur. Non-imgur links will be considered on a case by case basis. Please message the moderators with a link to your post for approval.

- All video submissions are considered on a case by case basis. Please message the moderators with a link to your post for approval.   

- Civility is a requirement for participating on /r/DIY. We try to stick to a ""3-strike"" policy for rule infractions - however moderators reserve the right to bypass this policy any time. A temporary ban constitutes a ""strike"".



---

> ###Important note:
>
> Finished DIY project submissions without adequate details / photos will be removed. Consider submitting these photos to /r/somethingimade instead. /r/DIY is about the process rather than the result.
>
> A good rule of thumb is somebody who sees your post should be able to relatively get close to being able to replicate the project with the information you've provided

&nbsp;

^(This sub is not ***only*** for templates. It is for memes in general, themed in an economic perspective. )

###***[Please send us your suggestions!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMemeEconomy)***

***

**Our sidebar and rules are updated frequently to stay up-to-date with the current market. Please check our sidebar often for any edits or additions you might have missed.**

***

**Rules:**

1a. Submissions and submission titles must be related to the meme economy. **For Example:** ""I found this meme,"" is not OK. ""I found this meme, should I buy or sell,"" is OK. All post titles should reference buying or selling at a minimum, and you can browse the [Investopedia Financial Dictionary](https://www.investopedia.com/dictionary/) if you need some inspiration.

1b. Titles should explain why users should invest in the meme.

2. Please invest effort in submissions and post a template for your meme. Posts with low-effort, commonly used titles, and barely-relevant content are strongly frowned upon and are subject to removal.

3. Please be respectful. No personal attacking. Be civil in the comments. ***This does not mean that you should report someone every time they call you a rude name or because they have a differing opinion.***

4. Standard anonymity is required. Posting personal information without consent is not allowed.

5. No reposting (*Within reason*). If a post is clearly shown to be a repost, it will be removed. Crossposting is allowed as long as Rule 1 is followed and the meme is presented in an economic context. If you report a repost please include a link to an earlier post with the same content to make it easier for moderators to verify and remove the repost.

6. Please respect the economy. Sharing false market information (such as sharing fake screenshots) is a crime that is subject to possible punishments based on the severity of the submission.

7. No spamming or advertising.

8. Please keep NSFW, offensive material, and controversial topics to a minimum. Read [rule #8](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/rules/) and send a modmail if you have any questions.

9. This is a forum for reputable investors only. Your account must be older than 7 days and have at least 50 comment karma to post.

10. Standard [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) apply.

&nbsp;

*Failure to comply with any of the rules in place may result in post/comment removal or an account ban. All title-related infractions will result in a 3 day ban for the first offense, subsequent offenses will have progressively longer bans. If you need to speak with the moderators directly, please don't be afraid to [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMemeEconomy).*

2s5oq,t5_2s5oq,LifeProTips,"#What is a Life Pro Tip?

A Life Pro Tip (or LPT) is a specific tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way. 

An LPT is a specific action that yields a specific result, both of which must be contained in the title.

An LPT is concise and must be wholly contained in the title. You can expound in the comments, but the title must stand on its own.

 If it takes more than the title, you have described a procedure, not a tip. 

Advice is not a tip. 

Fortune cookies are not tips.

**NO POLITICS**

#LifeProTips Rules

1. Designate adult or non-family friendly tips as NSFW.

2. You must begin your post with ""LPT"" or ""LPT Request"".

3. Do not submit tips that could be considered common sense or common courtesy. Do not submit unethical tips.

4. Use descriptive titles when posting! Your title should explain the gist of the LPT.

5. Posts must be either a life pro tip or a request for one.

6. No tips that are considered illegal in the United States. See: Grounds for permanent bans.

7. No religious or religion related tips. We are a religion free zone. Proselytize elsewhere.

8. Please remember to Flair your post for ease of navigation of the subreddit!

9. No tip piggybacking! Do not make tips in reaction to other posts on this subreddit. 

#Disallowed Life Pro Tips

These types of tips are not allowed and will be removed.

* Product specific tips. This includes Operating Systems like Windows and Android, businesses like Chipotle or HR Block, or websites like YouTube.
* Common uses for products and services. Like buying batteries for gifts that need batteries.
* Medical, Legal, Financial tips. We cannot verify the qualification of those making those tips. This includes practicing medicine, eye/vision, skin care, dental advice, diet/nutrition, and mental health. Medication tips. Law tips. Biomedical donations. Credit building tips.
* Hygiene, personal grooming tips including make-up and hair. Sex related tip.
* Toilet-related tips.
* Install an adblocker tips.
* Cutting Onion Tips
* Non-secular tips
*  Mnemonic or memory tips.
* Tip lists or articles (Example: ""Top ten tips you need to know!"").
* Parenting-related posts/tips.
* Relationship posts/tips.
* Troll or joke tips.
* Commonly posted tips ([Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/wiki/commonlpts) for an index of common LPTs)
* Political posts/tips.
* Driving related tips. Don't drink and drive tips.
* Sleep tips.

**Note:** Moderators will use their own discretion to remove any post that they believe is low-quality or not considered a life pro tip.

#Banning policy

Bans are **given out immediately** and serve as a warning. **You may appeal** this initial ban by messaging the moderators and agreeing not to break the rules again. Please acknowledge the rule you broke!  ***Note: Bans will not be reversed if the post/comment in question has been deleted from your history.***

A temporary ban can not be appealed, and will expire at the end of the allotted time. 

**Note:** Homophobia, racism, harassment and general hate on ethnicity, sex, religion or anything else will result in a permanent ban that cannot be appealed. Tips that advocate/support illegal activities are also grounds for a permanent ban as well. Tips or comments that encourage behavior that can cause injury or harm to others will be cause for a ban. As the majority of LPT Mods are US Based, we will be using US laws to determine whether or not it's legal. 

Thank you.

##[Subreddit Rules](https://i.imgur.com/zqhVQCP.gif)

- Rule 1A: All posts must have a short, boss (enemy type) style title. We thoroughly encourage creative boss names, reference other posts for good examples. Extremely low effort titles, including certain uses of apostrophes, are subject to removal at the moderator's discretion. Additionally, we usually remove posts that have extremely overused phrases in it (""Destroyer of Worlds, etc). If your title does not meet this rule we can help suggest a new one. 

- Rule 1B: Regarding accent posts. Using standard words as the name of your boss and supplementing it with accents will be regarded as low effort, exceptions are made if the title is transformative. Titles such as ""Dög, defender of the lawn” will be subject to removal. Accents may be included if they are not over used and are not used to supplement low effort titles.


- Rule 2: All posts must be in the style of a boss fight. No memes - memes are not in the style of bossfight. If your submission has lots of text, it is a subject to removal at the moderator's discretion. No text posts - shoot us a modmail if you have any questions or suggestions!

- Rule 3: No personal attacks / blatant offensive posts or comments. This includes but is not limited to: racism, homophobia, transphobia.

- Rule 5A: Reposts will be removed at the moderators discretion, this includes but is not limited to reposts with the same title as previous submissions. We allow some images to recirculate if a period of time has passed, or if it previously did not receive much attention. **If your post is part of a cluster of submissions of the same image, it will be removed**. Please check to see if your image has already been posted, especially if you are visiting us through a link. **Posts of the Tuba Man in any form will result in a 7 day ban.**

- Rule 5B: Please be sure to rename your files to something unique! If your post is removed for rule 5 due to our bot it will stay removed!

32csr,t5_32csr,confusing_perspective,"####Forced perspective is a technique that employs optical illusion to make an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is. It is used primarily in photography, filmmaking and architecture. It manipulates human visual perception through the use of scaled objects and the correlation between them and the vantage point of the spectator or camera.

This subreddit is for posting screenshots, pictures, or stories of people who are being **way** too picky when it comes to who they beg for a relationship or any other matter.

**Rules:**

 1. Blur out identifying info (Age, Name(s), Location, etc). This includes OP's info.

 1. Please use [Imgur](http://imgur.com) or Reddit for image hosting.

 1. Please be nice to other users.

 1. Don't link to other sub-reddits (You will be banned)

 1. Don't incite others to visit the page a given post pertains to.

 If you ever notice brigading, please report and message the moderators

 1.  Person must be a beggar, such as: 
* **Person seeking goods or services at a reduced cost, for free, or for a laughably lopsided trade**
* **Person using social media, dating apps, or otherwise to seek out a specific type of relationship**


 1.  Person must be choosy, as in:
* **Person must have unreasonable standards or have a comical sense of entitlement**
 1. No reposts from top 100, front page or last 12 months.

 1. **Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.**

 1. Please make an effort with your title. ""Found on Facebook"", ""This belongs here"", ""Saw this on snapchat"", ""🍆💦"" etc are hard to find later, give at least a little bit for us to go on, thanks.


#Here is what is NOT a ChoosingBeggar:

***
**Unattractive people seeking a normal relationship and having reasonable standards is not a good fit for this sub. Ugly people are allowed to want a partner with a job, or no kids, or anything else we would consider reasonable for the beautiful people.**

***
**A person asking for help with life's necessities out of desperation is not a choosingbeggar** 

* If someone ran out of money and needs gas money to get to work and the only thing they can think of is to make a status update on Facebook asking if anyone can spare them some money, they aren't really being choosy. They got the beggar part down, but this sub is not /r/beggars so that post wouldn't fit. If that same person turns down someone offering to give them a ride to work because they don't want to be seen in a PT Cruiser, then that post would fit.

*  A parent asking for handouts because their kids want an Xbox  for Christmas and the only way that could happen is if someone donates one, that isn't a choosingbeggar. That's someone begging, but without a sense of entitlement. If that person is offered a Nintendo and they scoff at the suggestion, then that would be a good post.

**The person begging must be at least in the gradient of being an entitled jerk, this sub is not a place to mock poverty**

[**RULES OF THE ROAST:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/about/rules/)

**Roastees:**

 * You must provide at least one high-quality picture of the roastee holding a handwritten sign with the text /r/RoastMe - Phones and Snapchat text overlay is **NOT** allowed!

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on ""Best Of"" and ""Highlights"" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No NSFW material. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh.
 
 * You are allowed to look through the roastee's post history.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**

If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

#[**Rules for Submissions**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules)

I. **Titles**

1. All titles must begin with [PsBattle:](/submit/?title=PsBattle:%20)

    This *is* case sensitive and must include a space after the colon.

2. Titles must *objectively describe* the subject of the image.

    2.1. No jokes, editorialising, or giving background info. The quality of the image is more important than how catchy the title is. 

    2.2. Requests, such as ""Please photoshop me or my friend"", are not permitted. Please review our suggestions below for an appropriate subreddit.

    2.3. Questions, such as ""Where else could he be?"" are not permitted.

    2.4. No personal anecdotes or mention of your connection to the image.

    2.5. No clichés such as ""this has potential"", ""make this epic"", ""This cat/dog/baby"", or ""My friend/daughter/son..."".  

II. **Image content**

1. Submissions must be a *direct* link to a *single* image. Albums and paneled/tiled images will be removed.

2. Images must be reasonable quality.

    2.1. Images must be at least 600x600 pixels (360,000 pixels total).
 
    2.2. No [technically low-quality images.](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules#wiki_reasons_for_these_rules)

    2.3. Images must be relatively well framed, and free from noise, blur, and distortion.

3. No disallowed image content.

    3.1. No photos of tv screens / computer monitors / physical pictures / billboards / magazines, etc.

    3.2. Images centered around text or signs may be removed.

    3.3. No phone / computer screenshots.

4. Images that have already been photoshopped may be removed, including images with watermarks, logos, or added text.

5. Images that have active threads, or have been photoshopped here, or elsewhere, may be removed.

6. If the mods believe that someone would object to having their image photoshopped or shared (no snapchats), it may be removed.

7. Sexually suggestive and overly gory submissions may be removed. 

**Deleting submissions with work in the comment section is not tolerated, and will result in a permanent submission ban.**

#[**Rules for Commenting**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content. 

Comments that are cliché, karma chains, not an original photoshop, memes, reaction gifs, upvote gifs, or off topic are *subject to removal by the moderators without notification.*

NSFW tags must be used *generously*.

**Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.**

[*Link to comment rules page.*](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

---

**Voting**

Please upvote based on quality of work. **Lazy** shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh.

Please do not downvote *submissions* just because they do not have obvious potential.

Please [report](http://i.imgur.com/DYBtk.png) inappropriate content to the mods.

[**Flair tool and bot links (Mods only!)**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/bot-links)",14595565,False
2qm21,t5_2qm21,PoliticalHumor,"#####A subreddit for political humor (particularly US politics), such as political cartoons and satire[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)

Please link to the source whenever possible.

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts must be about U.S. Politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not on topic, it's going to be removed like voter registrations in Georgia. 

    We don't care if posts are conservative or liberal, but they need to be political. 

2. **Try to be funny.** 

    If you need to explain your joke to us in modmail, it's not funny. Make sure your title is a punchline or something relevant, and make sure your post is funny. 

    If it is intentionally designed to piss people off, it is not humor. 

   We seriously get to judge whether it's funny or not so please send your [complaints here](https://i.imgur.com/j8scqbd.mp4). 

3. **Be civil.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, you'll be shown the door. 

4. **Images only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or other subreddits is prohibited. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts.** 

 Use [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. If we recognize your post from yesterday prepare to die. 

6. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone.  If it happens, we will spank you, and the admins will spank us, creating a spank train that nobody wants to be part of. 




7. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 



###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* Generally, we have a ""two strikes and you're banned forever"" policy, but we reserve the right to not do that if you're being particularly bad. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. 

* Users who delete offending content are dumb because we, as moderators, can still see it and it just makes us think you think we're stupid. If you make us work harder your ban length will be squared, and then cubed. 

* Users who reply to ban messages with abuse will never be unbanned, and we will spam them with copypasta to the point where *they* get tired of *us*. 

* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.

### Need gadget advice?

## [Gadget Advice Superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky)

###Follow Us On Twitter!

##[@GadgetsReddit](https://twitter.com/GadgetsReddit)


 
### Domain white list
 
## \/r/gadgets works with a [domain white list](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist), any domain not on the list will need to be approved before the submission will be visible. 



### Please read the rules:

1. Submissions must be explicitly about a single gadget. (Posts about software or tech companies will be removed. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).

2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with. Native advertising and ""advertorials"" are also not allowed.

3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: 
   - The article must be from a white listed source.
   - The article must be about the gadget, not the company, its business practices, or delivery dates etc.
   - The submitter must not be affiliated with the campaign, company or website

4. No direct image or video links.

5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles. 

6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.

7. Keep discussions civil and respectful. Know your [reddiquette!](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation.

8. No Adult Material.

9. English only.

10. If you need advice about a gadget you should ask in the advice [superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky?num-1). However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. 

11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. 

12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).

### Moderation Policy

## We use the [reddit FAQ guidelines for spam](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) when removing spam posts. Additionally, we use a [whitelist system](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist).

## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.

# Posting Rules

**SURVEYS:** [OCT '17](https://redd.it/75vatg) | [OCT '12](http://redd.it/12itcu) | [APR '12](http://redd.it.com/styya) | [APR '14](http://redd.it/23q0jn)

Please use the following tags so we know which game you're posting about: [LoZ], [AoL], [ALTTP], [LA], [OoT], [MM], [OoA],[OoS], [FS], [WW], [MC], [FSA], [TP], [PH], [ST], [SS], [ALBW], [TH],
 [BoTW]

**Rules**

1. Minor spoilers such as area titles, dungeon names and character references are allowed but all Major spoilers including boss weaknesses, puzzle solutions and any large story plot points must be tagged and flaired at all times. Comments must use the format `[X Kills Y](/spoiler)`, ex: X Kills Y. Submissions please click the ""spoiler"" button after making your post.
2. All art must have a clear comment containing a direct link to the original source. Use Google's Reverse Image search to help find it: https://images.google.com/ If you want to post your own work, please flair it with the [OC] tag.
3. No ""low quality"" posts. This includes low quality memes, low quality pictures of things that look like they are from Zelda e.g red moons, yellow 'korok' flowers and triforce patterns and posts that are intended to just be better than someone else's.
4. Use the search function and the top posts of all time to check if your post has already been posted. If it's on the first page of all time or has been posted within the past month, it may be removed.
5. Be civil, try and keep the peace. Aggressive personal attacks, hate speech, witchhunting and trolling will all be removed but small disagreements are nothing to worry about.
6. No discussion or sharing of game ROMs, ISOs or any game material that may have been pirated. Emulator discussion however is completely fine.
7. No pornographic content/nudity is allowed, some NSFW is fine as long as it's tagged and related to Zelda. This doesn't mean hypersexualized stuff is okay.
8. No sales or purchases. This is not a marketplace, if someone specifically requests to buy something you have created, you may respond with a link to another place but no direct transactions.
9. No obvious self promotion. Linking to something hosted on your art page or youtube channel is fine but any obvious advertisements will be removed.
10. Reposts in general are fine, but reposts within a week will be taken down. Check the hot page before posting. 

*THEME DAYS:* 

* Feel free to post news about new official merchandise whenever you like but for unofficial goods, or photos of your personal collection, please post them on **Merchandise Mondays**.

* Most screenshots are free to be submitted at any time, but the following generic ones are restricted to **Screenshot Saturday**: opening titles, game overs, file select screens, Dawn of the Next Day and ""funny"" names for Link.

* **Self-Post Sundays** are our main discussion day. On those days we only allow text posts *directly about the games themselves*.

Only self-posts are allowed. However, you may still link to images within the self-post if the image is relevant.

**A couple of suggestions to follow:**

1. Leave the punchline out of the title!

2. Preferred to be a joke an actual father said, but not required.

3. Tag [NSFW] or [NSFL] if ever necessary. 

4. Remember to edit out any personal information that could lead to identifying people in real life. This includes, but is not limited to, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook/twitter/instagram screenshots.

##Rules:

----

1. Do NOT post anything other than 4chan screenshots. Do NOT link directly to 4chan.org. Do NOT post anything from unrelated websites. Your post must be a screencap of a 4chan thread, not a 4chan meme, or meta-discussion about 4chan.

2. Do NOT post screencaps over a year old, and do NOT omit the date and time stamp. Those posts belong in /r/classic4chan.

3. Do NOT crop your post poorly

4. Do NOT act like a basic reddit bitch. This includes cliche reddit phrases, subreddit mentions, puns, song lyrics, novelty accounts, getting lots of karma on a single post, and other dummy things that make you a manchild.  
E.g. not my proudest fap, /r/theydidthemath, I did nazi that coming, is this the real life, is this just fantasy, /u/[somethingstupid], 1000 upvotes, etc.

5. Do NOT reveal personal information, or post 4chan screenshots, that contain personal information of an individual. Do not post 4chan screenshots of Reddit account names.

6. Do NOT include any requests to ""include me in the screencap.""

7. Do NOT forget to mark NSFW content. The overall subreddit is SFW, so people need to really know when a submission is legit NSFW.

8. Do NOT break any rules that the mods might invent on the spot.

----

## Mission Statement:

----

We personally severely dislike reddit and everyone who frequents it. We believe it's a shitty, destructive echo chamber that does much more public harm than anything 4chan has ever done. We think it discourages communication and encourages passive, addict-like consumption. We are making reddit worse as a public service, hopefully driving you people away from this toxic, horrible website.",1021931,False

thatHappened? Really? She walked off the bus and they all clapped? Sure.  

This subreddit is for true stories that absolutely happened. No diggity. Like that one time...

#**Rules**

|||
|:--|:--|
|**1. Post incredibly true stories that totally actually happened.**|If your story is obviously true or verifiable, it will be removed.  This is a satire subreddit  for fleshed out stories, not just texts and one-liners. If your story is obviously true or verifiable, it will be removed.  
Your post must be a *story*. Not a sentence or a picture with text on it.  Take a moment before posting. The following are not allowed |Greentext. AdviceAnimals. Memes or image macros. Confessions. Texts. **Short Tweets.** Obvious satire.  Jokes. Forwards from Grandma. A picture with a single line of text.|
|Do not post anything with a hint of truth. | No news articles or LiveJournal type confession sites. If you're unsure if something totally happened or not, google it or do a reverse lookup. We will look very closely at submissions from Twitter.
|**2: No names, usernames, or profile pics.**| Also, no subreddit names. 
|**3: Screen shots only**. | Direct links to *anything* will be auto removed. No one will ever see them.|
|**4: ABSOLUTELY NO OFFSITE ACTIVITY**. | This is a zero tolerance policy. Do not reference anyone's Tumblr page, blog, wordpress or anything else. It doesn't exist. We're on reddit to have a laugh, not to ruin someone's day. If you're caught going offsite, you will be permanently banned and reported to reddit's admins. Period.|
|**5: No witch hunting, doxxing or personal information of any kind**. | Do not grab pitchforks and go after someone, save that shit for /r/PitchforkEmporium. Do not brigade other threads, on or off of reddit. Do not doxx someone featured in a post. You will be permanently banned and reported to the admins.
|**6: Make an effort with your submission**. | Titles must be descriptive. 
|**7. No politics** |We are no longer allowing posts centered around political current events, especially US politics. No race baiting or deliberately inflammatory material.|
|**8. Be civil**| Reminder: behave yourself. That's on you, no excuses. We will not tolerate hate speech, racism, or abuse of any kind. Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) or be banned.|
|**9. No reposts** |Please try to avoid common memes and over used stories in posts and comments. This is at moderator discretion. We will ban repeat offenders. *Reposts will also be removed*. 
|**Moderators reserve the right to remove or approve posts at their discretion**. |We're only human, like you. If you think there's an issue, feel free to message modmail.|

# Community Info
The sub is changed: I feel it in OC, I feel it in the comments, I smell it the upvotes... Much that once was OC, is lost, none now live who repost it.

Welcome to /r/lotrmemes, the place to shitpost all you want about Lord of the Rings, The hobbit, The Silmarillion and all other Tolkien related stuff. Here, we do not discriminate against memes, we accept them with open arms.

[JOIN THE DISCORD](https://discord.me/arda)

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LOTR_Memes_)

# Rules

* Standard Reddit rules apply.
* Only Tolkien-related shitposting.
* Crossover memes are allowed, as long as a lotr element is present in them.
* Tag Nsfw-posts as such if needed. You pervert.
* No harrasing or threatening other users for any reason what so ever.
* There is currently no rule against reposting, but please try to post as much OC as possible. If your repost is removed without a message, it was a repost of something that was just recently posted.
* Posts requesting or encouraging any kind of vote manipulation or brigading are not welcome. But then again, this is a shit-post sub. Try to keep it to a minimum.
* No Advertising
* No irl-politics. Claiming the throne of Gondor is allowed.
* You can request lotr-themed gifs [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/9hqlwd/gif_request_thread/?).

# **guide to a good hmmm**

**hmmms** are textless images that make you think about the context, do a double take, invoke a deeper meaning, or just leave you thinking about how or why they exist:

- [bizarre **hmmm**](http://i.imgur.com/WORLtGl.jpg)

- [humour **hmmm**](http://i.imgur.com/P5PLlvA.jpg)

- [arresting **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/vjTWeOw.jpg)

- [beautiful **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/eGXfj03.png)

- [confusing **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/yOysToi.jpg)

- [mystery **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/s81FiO1.jpg)

As long as they give you a good solid [**hmmm...**](http://i.imgur.com/Zv8OoCi.jpg) why would that bear be in a cubicle...

**hmmms** should be aesthetic and meaningful, avoid anything that is merely r/mildlyinteresting.

**[Rules and Regulations](#blue2)**

-----

**[[Reddit Global Rules]](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)**


-----

**[Content Restrictions](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Politics:](#blue0) [Political posts must be current.](#o0) Do not post any news snippets/articles/memes. Do not post about policy, allegations, or hearsay. If your post is political in nature it must include an individual or group actually behaving in a cringeworthy manner.**

* **[1.1: Agendaposting:](#blue0) If it becomes clear that your activity in this subreddit is dominated by fixating on a single issue, you will be confronted and you may be banned. It is okay to have strong opinions on an issue, but do not let them dominate your activity to the point where you are flooding the sub trying to push an agenda. This is an equal opportunity rule.**

* **[1.2: Be Civil:](#blue0) If you want to discuss politics or controversial/taboo topics in the comments you are free to do so as long as you can keep it civil. Your ideas will not get you banned, but the manner in which you choose to express them can and will.**

**[2: Explicit Racism and Bigotry:](#blue0) Refrain from making comments that are explicitly racist or bigoted. This is not a platform to proselytize race or gender politics. Intent matters here insofar as we are able to judge it, so try to keep your jokes and satire light and in moderately good humor.**

**[3: Don't Spam Posts:](#blue0) Spread your posts out. Don't post more than 4-5 things within a 6 hour period. Put some thought into your posts instead of just dumping an entire imgur album on us.**

-----

**[The Cardinal Rules](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Doxing:](#blue0) Remove all personal information from your posts and comments. (Please remember to block out usernames in your submissions)**

**[2: Harassment:](#blue0) Don't target individual users. Don't harass anyone who may be the subject of a post.**

**[3: Brigading:](#blue0) Do not ""invade"" or brigade other subreddits. Do not suggest a brigade or participate in one. We will catch you.**

**[4: Witch Hunts:](#blue0) Witch hunts of any kind are strictly prohibited.**

**[5: Violence:](#blue0) Do not glorify, encourage, or incite violence.**

>#Instant Regret 
> ##(in'-stint rē-gret') n.
> ####a subreddit dedicated to deliberate actions that unexpectedly lead to undesirable consequences and horrible results; things which may cause someone to say, ""oh man, did I just screw the pooch!""

---

>###Guidelines & Rules


>####**1) Videos and gifs must show regret.** No text messages or still frames.  Sometimes the display of regret is unmistakable. It can be evident in someone's face, or in their body language. Sometimes it's a judgment call. If you think it works, try it out. If we delete it, you were wrong. We are Reddit™ moderators. We are always right!
  
>####**A fail is not a regret.** Some ripper eating a swellbow while trying to bone a rail on the backside, (that's skater lingo for a bad crash. I looked it up (made it up)), isn't regret. There should be a look of surprise, and an expression that clearly says, ""Oh no. Oh, God no. I really should not have done that. Why did I do that?""

>#Other examples that aren't regret:  

>* Eating bad food and not liking it is not regret. You knew what was going to happen, dumbass. 

>* Laughter is not an expression of regret. It's just not.  

>* A picture of a sunburn or a crappy tattoo is not evidence of regret.  For all we know you like looking like a pumpkin, and definitely still want that potato tattoo on your ankle.

>####**2) Regret must be instant or near-instant.** If someone does something which only has bad consequences minutes or hours later, it is not considered instant. 

> ####**3) No Animal Abuse.** We love animals. They are capable of regret, but we don't want to see videos where their regret is the fault of humans, involves cruelty, injury or is in any way unpleasant. 

> ####**4) No compilations.** Just pick one good thing and go with it. Everybody likes it when you do that. 

>####**5) If the video is longer than 20 seconds,** please use a tag to tell everyone when the lead-up to the regrettable moment begins. For example [regret at 4:20]. Or post the video queued up to the point where things get good and the regret quickly follows. But, ultimately, these are just excellent suggestions. You're the director. Make it good. And don't worry. If it sucks, we'll get rid of it for you.

>####**6) Reposts are highly discouraged.** Reposts are allowed, but reposts which have been posted recently or are in the [top of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/instant_regret/top/?sort=top&t=all) will be removed.

> ####**No Dannys.** If your name is Danny and we find out we will ban you.

---

>###WE HATE SPAM!

>####We remove spam.

>####We exact vengeance on those who give us spam.

>####If you see spam, report spam.

>####If you see an account that uses a YouTube channel that takes videos from other channels in order to accumulate karma on said account. **Report that account,** We'll take care of it.

---

>####and finally...

>###REMEMBER YOUR REDDIQUETTE

>####Please, no abusive comments, hate speech, or any other personal attacks.

>####Doxing, brigading, and witch-hunting are not allowed.

>####This includes derailing commentary sections to complain about prolific users, and by that we mean ""Gallowboob is not against the rules"". Complaining about the OP rather than the content is an easy way to earn a temporary ban.

> ####The moderators reserve the right to remove posts & comments, and  to ban users at our own discretion. If we feel your post doesn't  fit, we'll remove it. If you are an abusive person, or an intolerable troll, we just might ban you. If you feel that your post or comment has been removed unfairly, **please feel free to message us.** We'll try to be nice. We're not perfect but we really are working on it.

>#### **If you see someone breaking the rules,** please [message the mods] (http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Finstant_regret) and let us know.

>#### Thanks! Now, please enjoy our sub and the consequences resulting from the poor choices made by your fellow humans.

**Rules**

1. Posts must be images that were meant to be funny, but are funny because they were so unfunny that they are ironically hilarious. Not simply poor jokes or random funny pictures. No posts that obviously fit better on other well-known subs. [See here for more details about what fits the sub](https://redd.it/ayydya). **Screenshots of comment threads from any website are also not allowed until further notice.**
> [Here's a list of content that will get your post removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/wiki/index)

3. No reposts. No content that has been posted in the last 3 months or is in the top 50 all-time posts.

5. No gore. NSFW posts should also be marked NSFW. Content can be NSFW without containing nudity; for example, a post that describes an explicit sexual situation through text.

6. Keep your video clips short. Anything longer than 10 seconds will be removed.",257089,False
37oez,t5_37oez,MostBeautiful,"**Finding beauty in the world around us**

- - -
**RULES**

Feel free to post anything that you consider beautiful but please read our **[rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/MostBeautiful/about/rules/)** first before submitting or commenting here.

**1. Reposts**
 
No reposts unless the content is 6 months old and archived. Please do a keyword search or use [KarmaDecay](http://karmadecay.com) before posting to check if an image has been submitted here before. Do not repost images currently in the top 100 submissions of all time.

**2. Attribution**

**2.1** Please credit content creators (photographers/artists/source of the content you're posting) either in the title or in the comments.  However, **do not include Instagram handles in the title**. Put them in the comments section if you wish to mention them. 

***If you habitually submit unattributed content here or ignore requests for attribution, your future submissions may be filtered.*** Use [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Google reverse image search](https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=wi&ei=mQLEVa3pHoypogTbpISIDQ&ved=0CBUQqi4oAQ) to try and identify the photographer/artist. 

**2.2** If you took the photo yourself, you can include (OC) in the title to indicate original content or say so in the comments. 

**2.3** When **crossposting non-OC content**, please credit the photographer/source ***even if you use the native crosspost feature***. Two reasons for this: (1) the original poster of non-OC content may have failed to credit the actual photographer/source and (2) embeds showing the OP and subreddit are not visible in third-party apps. Credit need not be given if you are crossposting your own content.

**3. Image quality/resolution**

Please avoid submitting low-effort, badly composed, poor-quality images. 

**4. Post/submission limit**

Do not submit more than ***two images within a 24-hour period, whether OC or non-OC***. Any more than this will be removed and you may be requested to post the other image(s) some other time.  

**5. NSFW images** 

NSFW images must be labeled as such as a courtesy to users who would prefer not to view them. 

**6. Direct links only**

Please use direct links to images hosted on Reddit, Imgur, or Flickr. The URL must end in *.jpg or *.png.
 
**7. Be nice**

Remain civil in your interactions with others and follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). 

---
**Reminders**

**1.** Posts and comments may be removed if they are deemed to be unsuitable for the sub. Users' posting privileges may be restricted at the moderators' discretion.

**2.** When submitting images of landscapes, mention the location (if known) either in the title or in the comments. 

**3.** Try to keep your titles simple and descriptive.

**4.** Please report rule-breaking posts or comments. For other concerns, suggestions, or questions, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMostBeautiful).

***1. all posts must be titled anime_irl.***

***2. tag nsfw content (but no nudity allowed... baka)***

***3. be nice.***

***4. posts must be in anime style. screencaps from anime, manga, VNs, as well as anime-style games, fan art and comics are all okay.***

***5. all posts must be expressive/relatable in nature, this means no date posts. if your content isn't relatable, it might be more fitting for /r/animenocontext, /r/animemes, /r/KizunaA_Irl, /r/animefunny or /r/whataweeb. posts that are more fitting for those subreddits may be removed from here, especially meme-y ones.***

***6. direct links only, preferably hosted on reddit, imgur or gfycat.***

***7. no screenshots of websites or social media, such as tweets, news articles, reddit, text messages etc.***

***8. no current political posts.***

***9. no real life images of people or places.***

for the extended version of our rules, check [this out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/about/rules/)

***if you know the source of the anime, post it in the comments using /u/Roboragi!***  
/u/Nihilate has brought us the magical manga and anime linking robot. [here's how it works!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3qn6qk/animeta_introducing_roboragi_a_bot_which_helps/)

to add a spoiler tag, put the show or episode you're talking about in brackets [Like this!], then type the spoiler like so: 

(/s ""Spoiler goes here"")

[Waifu Spoiler] (/s ""Your waifu is garbage"") 

if you want to tag your submissions with a spoiler warning for a specific anime, message the moderators with a link to your post by using the ""message the moderators"" button in the sidebar.

2rvxp,t5_2rvxp,niceguys,"**NEW** [Check out our discord](https://discord.gg/e5bXkBE)

For all the self proclaimed ""nice guys"" who are actually manchildren or douches, or who mistake being spineless and pathetic for being nice.

Most of the posts you find here will feature men, but posts featuring women who fit the nice guy archetype are allowed. (Or gay men, or gay women, etc). Niceguyness transcends gender and sexuality.

This is lighthearted subreddit for funny, cringey images, NOT a subreddit for showcasing misogyny or debating gender roles.


**Rules**

* Absolutely no personal information in submissions or comments. Do not try to dig up info on the people you see here or try to find their accounts on other websites. **When you post, blur out or black out usernames and other personally identifying information**

* **NEW**: Avoid low effort titles like ""found one!"" and ""I'm just gonna leave this here."" See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/8pb3c1/introducing_a_ban_on_loweffort_titles/) post for more information

* No direct linking to reddit threads as a submission. Take a screencap instead. Black out or blur out usernames.

* Satire must be clearly stated as such. No fake content.

* No videos

* Reposts will probably be removed, especially common ones. An album of some of the most common reposts can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/Kn36b).

* Selfposts about how you used to nice guy but aren't now are boring and will probably be removed.

* Basically any post mods deem to be boring or off topic will probably be removed.

* Most memes will be removed since we want to focus on interactions with niceguys

* If you want a detailed explanation of how we define a ""NiceGuy,"" see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/wiki/definition)

* Someone made /r/niceguysdiscussion for the self posts we're removing from here. Go there to escape our censorious reign.

33o0p,t5_33o0p,assholedesign,"For when the designers know exactly what they're doing... but they don't care because they're assholes. 

This is a subreddit for designs specifically crafted to make the experience worse for the user. This can be due to greed, apathy, laziness or just downright scumbaggery. 

Also check out /r/Clickshaming and /r/AntiAssholeDesign

###Rules


**R1: [Posts Must Abide by Hanlon's Razor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)** *""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""*

[Here is our Hanlon's Razor showcase](https://imgur.com/a/HnIhw0Y) for some common topics that fall under this rule.

*Posts in violation of this rule may be appropriate for /r/crappydesign, /r/softwaregore, /r/NotMyJob, /r/MildlyInfuriating, /r/Wellthatsucks/, or /r/ExpectationvsReality*

**R2: No, It's Not Literal.** *""haha it's, like, an actual asshole in [/r/AssholeDesi](https://reddit.com/r/assholedesign)""—STOP! You're not being clever. The joke is dead. Violation of this rule will lead to an immediate ban.*

**R3: Don't be Subtle.** *Please make it obvious what you’re trying to highlight. A clear and concise post title can go a long way.*

*If we remove your post for this, we either don't know what we're supposed to be seeing here or aren't sure how it's malicious.*

**R4: Be Civil.** *We’re here to make fun of assholes; don’t act like one.*

**R5: No Recent Reposts.** *Six months is our cooldown limit. Also applies to any posts on our [Banned Reposts](https://imgur.com/a/0XBWbm3) album.*

**R6: No Witch-Hunts.** *We don't care what other subreddits do. No brigading! Don't call out individuals, but corporations are fair game.*

**R7: Screenshots > Direct Links.** *Screenshots are forever.* Please do not link directly to examples of Asshole Design. Linking to news articles about asshole design, resources, and the like is okay.

**R8: Posts must display aspects of design.**

**R9: No low effort content.** *This rule will be enforced loosely in order to preserve the image of the subreddit.*

###Guidelines

**G1: We're not limited to programming.** *Asshole design goes beyond the computer screen. Some of our best posts have been from non-technical stuff.*

**G2: You can post positive things, too!** *Informational videos demonstrating malicious techniques, resources for combating assholedesign, etc. are all completely acceptable.*

**G3: Satire and Lampshade Hanging is acceptable if tagged appropriately**. *Satire is ridicule of asshole design techniques, and should be tagged under the ""Satire"" flair. Lampshade Hanging is subversion of asshole design techniques and should be tagged under ""Lampshading"". 

**G4: Bots & novelty accounts are subject to arbitrary bans.** Some users have issued concerns regarding certain bots and their use as a constructive part of Reddit. Some bots might be banned, others may be allowed to stay. This rule will be enforced on a case-by case basis.

If you have content that doesn't directly relate, (switch console questions, Zelda in general, etc.) please see our related subreddits list for places where your content may apply.

Please be mindful of the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), [reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), and our [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/about/rules/).

**Rules**
--------------
**Harassment / Witch Hunting**

*No calling out specific users, insulting specific users or devolving discussion into arguments.*

 

**Low Quality Submission**

*Posts more suited for their Facebook page or blog, not all low quality posts need removal but the report brings it to a moderator's attention.*

 

**Sexism, Political, Racial, Or Any Discrimination**

*Political memes are allowed, but not if they reflect affiliation with a certain political party. For example, a post like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/61z7t1/make_chests_great_again/) is allowed, it's not taking a side, it's a Zelda play on a common meme. However, future posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/62fcij/if_it_starts_to_rain_im_blaming_the_democrats/) will be removed due to bashing a political party.*

 

**Off topic**

*Posts unrelated to the subreddit. Applies to some comments but not always enforced on them.*

**No porn**

*There's subreddits for that and this isn't one.*

2szyo,t5_2szyo,Showerthoughts,"## About

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

""Showerthought"" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable.

## Rules  

- **All content must be original and unique.**    
Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on Reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_exceedingly_nonsensical_or_unoriginal_posts_may_be_removed_at_the_discretion_of_the_mods_.28including_posts_that_would_fit_better_in_other_subreddits.29.)

- **Your entire thought must be in the title.**
      Any further information needs to be posted in the ""body"" section of your post.

- **No shower ""observations.""**    
A description of something in a literal shower (or bathroom) is not a showerthought. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_no_shower_.22observations.22.)

- **No jokes, puns, or wordplay.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_no_puns.2Fwordplay.)

- **No ""life pro-tips"" or advice.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_no_jokes)

- **No commentary on Reddit or its functions.**    
Ideas for Reddit features should be posted in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_no_.27life_pro_tips.27)

- **No thoughts about politics, social justice, or religion.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_no_political.2C_social_justice.2C_or_religious_related_posts)

- **Don't be a jerk.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index#wiki_don.27t_be_a_jerk)

> [Please see the full rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/index) 
 
> Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene.

> **This subreddit is moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not ""[let the votes decide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)."" We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a high-traffic subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

2vy3g,t5_2vy3g,blunderyears,"**Guidelines**

**1 - True blunders only**

Simply being nerdy just isn’t going to cut it. If you wore your “nerd glasses because you thought you were so hipster,” that’s not enough of a blunder.

Halloween costumes do not count!

**2 - You must have a creative title.**

No ""Puberty has been good to me."" or ""LOL I was random!"" type titles. This is rule is entirely decided by the mods' discretion. 

**3 - Your blunder must have been at least 3 years ago**

No ""still blundering""

**4 - Childhood photos are great, as long as they actually depict a blunder.**

Don't post a picture of yourself as a child just because you're dressed as a child, playing with your Furby, in a sandbox, etc. This isn't #ThrowbackThursday. If it's an actually embarrassing childhood photo though, then fantastic! 

**5 - It’s suggested that you provide a “now” picture, but you don't HAVE to.** 

If the OP hasn't provided a ""now"" picture, it’s okay to request one, but *don't* push it: not everyone wants their current photo on Reddit. Do not go through the OPs post history and post one for them either. 

Also, a mere picture of your face is not a blunder. If you want to show how attractive you've become after puberty, head over to /r/uglyduckling. They'll love you there.

**6 - Ask permission if there are other people in the photo**

Especially if someone else is the subject of the photo. This isn’t the place to get your blackmail on.

**7 - Be thoughtful when replying**

We have absolutely zero tolerance for:

* Blatant insults, racism, homo/transphobia, trolling, threats, or “you’re still blundering”-type comments.

* ""10/10- would bang"", ""15 year old me would have wanted to be all over you"" or ""damn, you certainly developed nicely"" -type comments

* Creepy compliments

* Certain subreddits are prohibited to linking to. Please see the banned words list.

Comments containing some specific words are automatically banned. [Here is a full list](https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/wiki/banned_words).

Please report comments that violate this rule. Violations of this rule can and will result in an immediate ban!

**8 - No posting personal information**

This includes for yourself or other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook or other social media accounts.

**9 - Report content that breaks the rules**

We can't keep an eye on every single post and comment in the subreddit 24/7. Don't hesitate to contact the moderators for any reason.

**10 - All posts are subject to removal without notice at the mods' discretion if the post does not catch on.**

We strive to keep the quality of the posts at a high level and if your post does not catch on then it probably does not belong here in the first place.




That’s it! Have fun and laugh at each other, and yourself!

##FAQ

1. [What does 'fam' mean?](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fam)

1. [Can I be a mod?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQyDNs8ZzHI)

1. [WTF is going on here?](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-barber)

1. **Can I get a flair?** Yes, you can choose from predefined flairs. Alternatively, if you're in the right thread at the right time syz might give you some offensive shitflair. If you have a concern about the flair you've been assigned please contact us via modmail so we can give you an alternative, more horrendous one in its place. [Hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justfuckmyshitup/comments/8dnhb2/i_need_the_worst_possible_style_for_my_head_shape/dxp6p0j/)

1. **What does my flair mean and when did i get it?** You don't get notified when you get shitflaired, so it might take you a while to notice it. Most flairs only make sense in the context of the comment you made when it was assigned, although even then they don't make sense tbh. Check your comment history and be grateful you're one of the special people that git flair

All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below and in:

> #[The r/lgbt FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/lgbt/wiki/faq)

# Rules

>**Rule 1:** No homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, acephobia, racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism of any kind. If you are unclear about what may constitute any of the above, please see the **[LGBT FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/lgbt/wiki/faq)**. If you are using triggering language in an educational or demonstrative capacity, we ask that you please wrap it in a trigger warning, e.g. `[](/tw ""problematic text"")`. If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: ""[TW] Title of Post""

---

>**Rule 2:** Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a **[safe space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space)**. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just ""shouldn't be so sensitive."" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. /r/ainbow does not moderate discussion, but the community will expect that you treat them with respect. For more information, see [/r/ainbow's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/wiki/index).

>**Rule 3:** Meta discussion will be directed to /r/LGBTOpenModmail. The mods check it frequently and will take suggestions into consideration.

##**COMMUNITY RULES**


**1.** Follow [reddiquette](http://tinyurl.com/otqpw4a) when posting. Heated discussions and normal arguments are fine, but please remember there’s a person on the other side of the screen. 

* Harassment, witchhunts, personal attacks and threats are bannable offenses. (Ban length depends on the severity of the asshole behavior). 

* Comment threads that dissolve into creepy behavior & shit-flinging will be locked and repeat offenders will be banned. Please report any concerning behavior to the mods. 

* Spamming will result in a ban. 


**2.**  As this is a semi-official community where the R&M crew and creators often contribute, 
posts & comments directly linking to torrents are *DISQUALIFIED*. Streams are okay though.

  * Posting leaks to any unreleased content is a bannable offense.


**3.** No Puffy Vaginas (Porn/34). Other NSFW content should be tagged.


**4.** This is a politically neutral subreddit. Overtly Politically loaded posts are *DISQUALIFIED*. Comment threads that dissolve into political shit-flinging will be locked. 

**5.** Posts and comments including personal information are *DISQUALIFIED* 


**6.** Unverified premiere dates & posts linking to clickbait/fake rumors are DISQUALIFIED

**7.** Requesting upvotes - *DISQUALIFIED*

**8.** Low-effort posts, memes and anything that qualifies as a Shitpost now belongs in r/Mortytown. 

   * Examples include (but are not limited to):

  * Stuff you saw IRL that reminds you of something you saw from Rick and Morty

  * Any memes, shitposts, captionposts, etc

  * Pickles, tiny food, blue smiley faces

  * That stock-art Pizza Man logo

  * Some chicken nuggets you found on the floor

  * Szechuan Sauce, The word ""Szechuan"" that you saw somewhere - perhaps on a Chinese Restaurant sign or menu

  * Captionposts

  * Egregious reposts 

  *(exceptions to be made for certain holidays and special events like cons and official events)*


&nbsp;

  *Break the cycle. Rise above the shitposts. Focus on Original Content.*

38oju,t5_38oju,crappyoffbrands,"This subreddit is a forum in which users can submit pictures or videos of examples of crappy or just plain funny off-brand versions of various products. These examples can be both from present day as well as from the past. We also encourage submission of examples on film and TV where a name-brand product is substituted for something more absurd.

Also encouraged are posts of bad knock-offs (fake versions of products that fail to resemble the original in pretty obvious and hilarious ways).

***Having trouble with the theme?***

RES users may experience conflicts with our custom theme, as RES is overzealous when applying its own styling (highlighting being a prime example) and breakages occur quite frequently.  We have detailed how to fix a common highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1ejx7t/highlighted_comments_hard_to_read/ca1nx3r), and a more recent highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1m1b3l/does_anyone_really_think_that_this_is_a_good/cc5kyxx).  RES users may benefit from switching to NIGHT-MODE too.  If you would prefer not to use our custom theme, you can disable custom themes globally in your reddit preferences (just untick ""allow subreddits to show me custom styles"" in the ""display options"" section), or locally by de-selecting 'Use subreddit style' at the top of this sidebar.",340944,False

1\. Hotlinking is not allowed without explicit permission, unless it is obvious that the host allows it (e.g. Imgur or other image hosting services). Rehosting for the purposes of offering a direct link to an image is allowed in the comments.


2\. All posts that have been on the first 2 pages of trending posts within the last month, is part of the top of all time, or is part of common posts is considered repost and will be removed on sight. 

3\. Any post on the list of common posts will be removed. [You can find this list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/wiki/commonposts).
Established meme formats are allowed, as long as the post is compliant with the previous rules.

4\. Titles must also be creative, high effort and relevant to the content. Titles such as “Interesting title”, “.”, “print(title)”, and “I don’t know what to put here” are not allowed.

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

# DISALLOWED QUESTION AREAS

These types of questions are not allowed and will be removed:

- Medical advice questions

- Trolling or joke questions

- Suicide related questions are best handled by the great resources they have at r/SuicideWatch or r/Suicidology

- Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/wiki/resources#wiki_rape_and_sexual_violence) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help). 
 
- Getting people to view your product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question

- Illegal things - nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

- Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophelia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

- Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed.

This subreddit features social media posts and messages written either partially or fully in Scottish patter.

#Posting guidelines
* All forms of Scottish patter are sound. 

* Keep personal information tae a minimum. Mods reserve the right tae remove posts and/or request personal information to be edited out at our own discretion.

* Link tae images directly. This makes browsing easier for folk using RES or on mobile.


* **Nae re-posting**. Common reposts or reposts within two months will be lifted at moderator discretion. 


* Nae cunt cares if a post is fictional. Comments along the lines of 'That happened' will be removed automatically and circumventing this will result in a temporary ban. **Comments that break site wide rules will also be removed and you may be banned.**

* **Dinnae force it in the titles. You will look stupid and we will all laugh at you**. Seriously it looks silly, stop making up daft words and sticking them in the title. **Also, one word titles will result in a ban without warning.** This is to help keep some sort of quality to the subreddit and combat spammers/karma farmers. Regardless, it's lazy.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that dinnae constructively contribute content or add tae discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/ScottishPeopleTwitter

This is a subreddit for memes that hit too close to home or are too real for subs like /r/meirl

We are not /r/depression however, the sticky is a good resource for if you need real help. If you have depression, talk to a therapist, it really does help. You are not alone, and recovery is possible and worth it.

If you find jokes about suicide, depression or self harm upsetting, this sub might not be the right place for you. This is a place for people who use self deprecating humor as a coping mechanism, not for those making fun of mental illness.

With that out of the way, the rules are as follows:

* **Asking for upvotes/downvotes will get you banned**. And any other vote related bullshit for that matter.

* Posts *MUST* be in some way ""too real"" or hit to close to home. If it doesn't make you laugh and feel sad at the same time, don't post it here. Posts that do not fit the sub may be removed.

* Being edgy doesn't make a post good. Post content that you find a bit too relatable, not something making fun of people with depression.

* Posts should be titled 2meirl4meirl or some variation, but other titles are fine for ~~shitposts~~ self posts.

* Be supportive. Most people here are going through something, and sometimes all it takes to improve a shitty day is just a little kindness from an Internet stranger.

* Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, any other form of discrimination and general dickishness *will not be tolerated.*

* Mark NSFW content as such. And please don't post NSFL content, we are not /r/watchpeopledie

* Reposts are allowed, but discouraged

* Don't link to an image if it won't be there permanently. Basically, just don't link to files hosted on 4chan.

* Again, please don't be an asshole.

* If any of you fucbois post mr skeltal you will not have good bones and calcium, and instead your post will be removed. Mr skeltal will not be thanked.

**POLANDBALL IS OF REDDIT**

Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the ""international drama"" of their diplomatic relations. Polandball combines history, geography, Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known German image board int ze internetz.

Polandball is unique and it should remain so. It's clearly distinguished from rage comics and memes.  Read the [**Official Polandball Tutorial**](http://i.imgur.com/dcW9rpR.png#red-text). To keep the quality of the content high, all comics have to comply to it.

* Non-subreddit things are welcome as well. Nazi backscratcher? Sounds great. Doggie masage chair? Surprising!

* All image posts that are not photographs of the 'thing' must include a comment by OP or they will be removed. 

* Please no memes/image macros, lists, and just be polite. Thanks!

* Please no self promotion. This is a place for the oddities we happen upon, not the curiosities we created.

* No racist, hateful, or threatening comments. If you see a comment that you believe is breaking this rule, *report it!* Violators will be banned.

In the event that something goes wrong, or you feel that someone is breaking the rules, send modmail! It would be a fantastic world if simply pressing ""report"" would cause the blue internet midgets to run and deliver the message, but we're still decades from that technology. By sending modmail, you ensure that your problem will be looked at, because modmail shows up in my inbox. Reports do not. Shine on, you crazy diamonds!

#FAQ

*What is an MLM?*

> The idea behind MLMs is that people pay to become distributors of a product. These can be physical products or services. The company is structured so that the people above (the person who recruited or signed up the new distributor, the people above them, ad infinitum) get a percentage of whatever the distributor sells. The new distributor is encouraged not only to sell the product, but to sign up other people below them so that they can make even more money. *courtesy u/copacetic1515*

*What is a ""Hun""?*

> People who shill products/services for an MLM. The sellers have a tendency to frequently use the word ""hun"" when initiating a sales pitch. Ex: “Hey hun ❤️❤️ I see your aunt is dying 😱😱 anyway hun 😊💁‍♀️ wanna buy my oils it’s good for stress 😍😘😘” *courtesy u/fiestaspongebob*

---

### Suggested Content

Here are a few examples of the type of content we actively seek:

* Rational arguments against the MLM business model
* Examples of business or mathematical delusion
* Tone-deaf advertising
* Boundary-crossing, predatory relationship abuse
* MLM legal news and developments
* Share tips on how to stop a friend in a scheme.
* Dank antiMLM related memes, gifs and shitposts only

##**About The Subreddit**

The sub for dogs with jobs, both silly and serious. Working doggos of all types are welcome here.

**Your post should fit into one of our two categories:**

**Serious Jobs**: These are the true working dogs. Police & military dogs, service dogs, therapy dogs, guide dogs, sheep herding dogs, livestock guardian dogs, search & rescue dogs etc.


**Silly Jobs**: These are dogs with pretend jobs. Most often, silly jobs will be a dog dressed in a costume. [A 'dogtor'](https://redd.it/7ta7ou) for example. The silly job should be based off a real human job. [Read this post](https://redd.it/azux6s) to see what counts as a silly job.

#If moderators feel your post is stretching the idea of a silly job too far, it may be removed.

##**Rules**

1. **Please be kind**. Treat your fellow Redditors with respect. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. 

2. **No reposts from the [top 100 all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/top/?sort=top&t=all) and no reposts from the last 6 months.** Please use **[karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com)** and search some keywords before posting.

3. **If we cannot tell what the dogs job is by the pic/gif/video alone, the title must make it clear.** For example, if you post a picture of a service dog without it's vest on, you will need to specify in the title that it's a service dog. Otherwise, for all we know it's just a picture of a dog standing there. - Please use descriptive titles. Your title should be at least 16 characters long (spaces included).

4. For the purposes of this sub, **your pet dog who also guards your house is not considered a dog with a job.** This rule is mostly to prevent an overabundance of posts of dogs looking out a window or door.

5. **Your pet dog:**

- Unless your dog is specifically trained to be a therapy or service dog, **your pet dog who makes you happy is not a dog with a job.** 

- Taking a picture of your pet dog and calling him a **model does not count as a job**. Dogs who appear in movies or official advertisements are allowed.

- Taking a picture of your dog laying next to a child and calling him a **babysitter does not count as a job.**

6: **Sneak shots of service dogs and guide dogs are banned.** Do not post photos you took of a service or guide dog in public unless you have permission from the dogs owner. More info on this rule can be found **[here](https://redd.it/a3ijaj)**.



##**If you see a rule violating post please report it.**

# A subreddit about photography techniques and styles.

****

####**[RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/about/rules/)** 
#####(Hover for more info)
####Submissions should be:

###A **photograph** 

> - No paintings, illustrations or heavily altered images.

###A photograph that **you** took 

> - You must be the author of the photos posted. 
> - If you have concerns of plagiarism, please [contact the mod team directly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fitookapicture&subject=Suspected%20plagiarism&message=Include%20a%20link%20to%20the%20submission%20in%20the%20message!) with proof.

###A **single** photograph 
> - Albums and other images can be posted in comments.
> - Panoramas, stacked images, panographs and double exposures are allowed.

###A photograph that demonstrates an effort to teach/learn **technique** or **artistic style**, or which is being shared as an example of **quality photography**
> - **Submitters must participate in the discussion**. Whether it's a photographer asking the community at large what s/he could have done better, or users asking how to achieve a look or effect, posters are expected to contribute to the comments section.
> - **No snapshots.** Your photo should be well-composed, have an obvious subject, feature good use of color/tone and/or texture, have interesting lighting, and make purposeful use of depth of field.

###All submission titles **must start with ""ITAP""** and only describe the contents of the image
> - Keep titles short and descriptive of the photo.
> - Do not include intention, reaction, backstory or click-bait. Any additional information you'd like to provide should be added in a comment.

###Mona Lisa Monday — **[MLM]**
> - Photos with a primary focus on one person staring, looking or thinking, without any other interesting action **are limited to Mondays (Midnight - Midnight, UTC).**
> - Photos of people in a state of action, reaction or interaction, or share their focus with an interesting setting or background, employ some unique photography technique or have exceptional / atypical styling (hair, makeup, studio setups) are not subjected to this rule and are allowed throughout the week.
> - Mona Lisa Monday submission titles **must include the [MLM] tag.**

Mona Lisa Monday is currently **not active**.  
MLM will begin in about 4 days, 5 hours.

######**Posting Suggestions**

> - Use [flickr](http://flickr.com/) or [imgur](http://imgur.com/) as they are RES friendly. Link directly to the image URL.
> - Avoid URL shortners and personal blogs/websites if you want to skip reddit's spam filter.
> - Comment on your submission with basic information: What gear you used, your camera settings and 1-2 sentences on how and why the photograph was created. This is the best way to avoid getting flagged as a snapshot if you’re a beginner. You're welcome to ask questions about things you're unsure of as well (in the comments).
> - If you want others to look at, vote and critique your photo, you need to make an effort to engage with commenters, answer questions and respond to criticism.
> - Don’t take offense to negative feedback. Understanding your mistakes and shortcomings is the best way to overcome them in future work.

######**Commenting Guidelines**

> - Constructive criticism is what this sub is here for. Structure your feedback on what you like about the photo, what you don’t like, how you would improve it. “Great Photo” may be a nice compliment, but it does nothing to help the submitter or other readers.
> - Abusive language will result in a ban. This includes insults, swearing and sexual comments.
> - Off-topic comments unrelated to the photo will be removed.

######**Additional Terms**

> - *By submitting your photos to /r/itookapicture, you are implicitly consenting to* ***allowing your photos to be submitted to our Instagram account*** *[(@Reddit_ITAP)](http://Instagram.com/reddit_itap). However, if at any time you do not wish to have your photo shared on IG,* ***you may opt out*** *by stating so, whether it is at the time it is posted on ITAP, by contacting the mods directly, or in the comments on either the Reddit or Instagram posts.*

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.

While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.

Rules:

1. Story or photos must display some form of malicious compliance. This is interpreted broadly, but posts where people ignore rules will be removed.

2. No gore/death images. If in doubt, just ask.

3. Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.

4. Respect Copyrights. If it’s not yours then do not post it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin & Hobbes. You can link to most youtubers. You can link to a comment or post you found on Reddit or twitter.

5. Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.

6. It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).

7. No Hypothetical Compliance. If you want to talk about a rule you want to skirt, I get that but, post here when you have already done it. An image of a stupidly worded sign alone is nothing.

Rules (subject to extreme change, please send hate modmail if you don't like them.)

1) Videos and pictures of people doing anything that makes you uncomfortable just at the sight of it. Look for examples of submitted content before submitting your own

2) No more pictures of things not directly related to things that aren't sweaty-palms inducing (ie pictures of spaghetti)

3) No porn

4) No being a dick in general (racism etc.)

5) No fake/staged/forced perspective images or videos if they have no sweaty palms inducing qualities. Some of them work, most of them don't. If I can tell it's fake, I'll probably remove it.

6) No reposts

3g7ta,t5_3g7ta,BoneAppleTea,"#What is a Bone Apple Tea?

Bone Apple Tea began as a meme where someone said, obviously, ""bone apple tea"" instead of bon appétit. The meaning of a Bone Apple Tea is slightly different now:

**A Bone Apple Tea is a [malapropism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism)**, which is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, sometimes humorous utterance. An example is the statement by baseball player Yogi Berra: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes"", rather than ""electoral votes.""

# [Join our Discord!](https://discord.gg/EqP57YJ)

#Rules

**Rule 1**: Post must show a malapropism. Typos, autocorrect, and words spelled incorrectly are not allowed. A true bone apple tea is the mistaken use of a  **real, dictionary defined** word in place of a similar-sounding one.

**Rule 2**: No movie quotes or puns.

**Rule 3**: No reposts or banned posts:

Have you ever created a meme so dark and depressing that it would simply not fit on /r/me_irl? Have you ever found a relatable image that made you feel like a worthless human being? Have you ever just felt that an image was *too meirl for meirl*?

*This is the place to post it!*

General Rules:


1. All posts must be funny, and relateable. 

2. Bigotry is grounds for a ban and severity can vary. 

3. Depression and anxiety related content is encouraged. Also check out /r/2meirl4meirl instead for that extra edge.

4. The title should be generally along the lines of 'too me irl for me irl', and images are preferred to be on imgur. Text posts are allowed, if about the subreddit, attach [meta] to the title.

5. Posts asking for upvotes will be banned

6. This is a place for self-deprecating humor about mental illness and personal struggles. Sometimes laughter is the best medicine. We're here to laugh at ourselves, not put down others.

###Reaction?

A reaction gif is a physical or emotional response that is captured in an animated gif **which you can link in response to someone or something on the Internet.** The reaction must not be in response to something that happens within the gif, or it is considered a ""scene."" For example:  
  
* [Scene.](http://i.imgur.com/eFlYEsc.gifv)  
* [Reaction 1.](http://i.imgur.com/3ODbnTM.gifv)  
* [Reaction 2.](http://i.imgur.com/vOOMz3F.gifv)

###Rules

1. Your gif must actually contain some sort of reaction. Your submission title has no bearing on whether the gif you submit is a reaction gif or not. Non-reactions and analogies will be removed.
2. Upvote, downvote, inbox and reddit gold gifs are not allowed and will be removed. Please direct your submission to /r/upvotegifs or /r/goldgifs.

6. No gore or porn/nudity.
7. You must use an appropriate host listed below for your gif.
8. Let me make this clear: If you make [OC] and you want [OC] Flair, you gonna have to tag that shit [OC] in the title, capisce?
9. The rules are the rules.  Deal with it like an adult.  Don't mention or complain about rules or mod teams of any subreddit.
10. Keep comments civil.   Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, etc is not tolerated and will result in a ban, even if you think you are just joking.
11. No spoilers.  Do not post spoilers for current shows or movies. Use spoiler tags when discussing any recent shows or movies.
12. Do not engage in witch hunts or brigades. reddit is not your personal army.
13. We do not allow participation of users from hatereddits that ban due to actions in other subreddits.

####**What is WoahDude?**

The best links to click **while you're stoned!** 

Psychedelic, mind-bending, mesmerizing, reality-distorting, or trippy games, video, audio & images that make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!

No one wants to have to sift through the entire internet for fun links when they're stoned - so make this your one-stop shop!

* We are **NOT** a ""reaction subreddit"".

* We are **NOT** a subreddit about interesting or amazing content. 

* We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.

* We are specifically made for **PSYCHEDELIC CONTENT**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder! We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality.

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerizing. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

Here's a ⇨ [more in-depth explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) ⇦

####RULES  [⇨ FULL VERSION](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki) 

Rules | | Description
---------|----------|----------
1. **WOAHDUDE MATERIAL** only| | **ALLOWED:** Trippy or mesmerizing content that meets [**our listed WoahDude criteria**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only).  This is not a mere ""reaction subreddit"". Don't post content just because it makes you literally say the words 'woah dude'. **NOT ALLOWED:** Rare talents, stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights. Things that are merely cool, amazing or unusual, but not in any psychedelic way.
2.  NO TOXIC BEHAVIOR!| |   Inconsiderate behavior is not compatible with the relaxed stoner atmosphere of our subreddit. [**Breaking this rule may result in a no-warning ban.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_2_-_no_toxic_behavior) Trolling, vote brigading, comment brigading, drama brigading, baiting, harassing, taunting, insulting, spoiling, being antagonistic or needlessly bothering users or mods or will not be tolerated. Be chill & please giggle like a giraffe :) 
3. LINK FLAIR required| |Your post must use the [**correct link flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_3_-_link_flair_required). Adding flair after a removal may not get your post approved.
4. DESCRIPTIVE TITLES required| |Your post must use a [**descriptive title**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_4_-_descriptive_titles_required). Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. ""woah"" or ""this is trippy"" is not a proper description.
5.  WARNING TAGS are mandatory | | When applicable you must include [warning tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_5_-_warning_tags_required) for **[bad vibes]** or **[epilepsy]** in your title. There is no flair for it. If you fail to include it in the title, your post will simply be removed and depending on the severity of the infraction you may be banned. Also toggle **NSFW** or **SPOILER** flair when applicable. **NSFL / gore** is never allowed.
6. No product advertising| |   Do not post or request links to product info pages or store fronts (directly or indirectly) or express desire for any information that can facilitate the acquisition of such information. Advertise only through the official channel.  ([**learn more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_6_-_no_product_advertising))    
7. Only certain reposts are allowed | | Learn more about [**our repost policy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_7_-_repost_policy) here. Reposts that aren't allowed may be reported via report button or modmail.
8. No low-effort submissions | | That includes quasi reposts, low quality files, and uninteresting content. ([**learn more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_8_-_no_low-effort_submissions))    
9. No back-seat modding ||If you spot content that you think violates any rule, use the report button or modmail us. Do not air your grievances in the comment section. [**Here's why**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_9_-_no_back-seat_modding).
10. Use direct links | | End [**the bullshit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_10_-_use_direct_links).
11. XPOST labels are banned | |Crossposts (also known as XPOSTS) are fine, just [**don't label them**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_11_-_xpost_labels_are_banned) as such.    
12. FREEBOOTING is banned | |Avoid posting content that is watermarked or rehosted by a party other than the author without their permission for personal or monetary gain. [**More specific information here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_12_-_freebooting_is_banned)  

**[REPORT A REPOST with this modmail form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/woahdude&subject=Avoid%20REPOSTS&message=This%20post%20has%20previously%20been%20posted%20in%20woahdude%20before:%0D[paste%20repost%20URL%20here]%0D%0DHere%20is%20the%20original%20post:%0D[paste%20original%20URL%20here])** and the offending repost will be removed ASAP.

######[](#list)
1. **No music from the [Hall of Fame](http://goo.gl/h1aUhL)**

##What is software gore?

**Software gore is when software acts outside its parameters and malfunctions. Software gore cannot be intentional, and it must not be a fault of the design (crappy design).**

[More details on Software gore](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaregore/wiki/software-gore)

##What isn't software gore:

* Asshole design - deliberately bad software (not software gore)
* Crappy design - Issues caused by poor design (not software gore)

[More details on what isn't Software gore](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaregore/wiki/not-gore)

##Before posting:

1. Is the issue here to do with design?
2. Is the issue intentional?
3. Is the software operating abnormally?

**If 1 and 2 are no, and 3 is yes, you might have software gore! Anything else and it isn't software gore.**

We see **a lot** of the same stuff. Please check this list **before you post**: [Done To Death Submissions](/r/softwaregore/w/done-to-death)

## Please note

Attempts to evade or circumvent post/comment removals (for instance, reposting previously removed content) or bans will result in further moderation action being taken against any offenders.

# Submission Rules

### 1. Posts must contain software gore. 

* This means they display a major error that is obvious to an average user. 

* Gore is unintentional and only concerns legitimate software. 

* Problems from user/designer/developer error are not gore.

### 2. Gore must be genuine. 

* Submissions which are faked or misleading will be removed. Violating this rule may result in a ban.

### 3. No submissions that have been Done To Death. 

* Many other users found this same error before you and posted it already. Check out our list of common [**Done To Death** submissions](/r/softwaregore/w/done-to-death).

### 4. Please make effort with your title. 

* If you're not a funny person or the gore is hard to figure out, use the title to point out the gore.

### 5. NSFW content must be tagged.

* Many users browse this subreddit in public or at work, so please press the `NSFW` button below your most to mark it as such.

### 6. No Personally Identifying Information

* Do not include personally identifying information in your posts or comments. This includes, but is not limited to, instagram/twitter handles, full names (like Facebook), phone numbers, email addresses, or addresses.


# Commenting Rules

### 1. Be polite to others. 

* Disagreement is definitely permitted, but don't be rude or hurtful.

### 2. Don't be pretentious.

#RULE 0: The sub name is not a challenge.
This subreddit is for videos/gifs where you wonder ""Why would a normal person film what was happening (or not happening when the clip starts?"" The goal is not to figure out why...
_____
**Rule 1: No Security footage or Staged clips**

This includes clips from CCTV's, security cams, dash cams, prank channels, IRL Streamers, etc.

**Rule 2: Don't police the sub.**

###[We're more of a lighthearted sub, don't take it too seriously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhyWereTheyFilming/)
If you come across a post that doesn't belong here, just downvote it and move on. If it's really egregious, a mod will remove it. Don't make a ""This doesn't belong here"" comment. They will be removed.


**Rule 3: Flair your posts!**

Please flair your post depending on whether it is a GIF or a video. Automod will be introduced soon to allow automatic flairs and filters too.

**Rule 4: No spam.**

Self explanatory. You spam, you get banned, simple as that.

**Rule 5: Don't be a dick.**

Come on, let's be nice here. If you're just gonna be an asshole, your comment will be removed.

**Rule 6: NSFW and NSFL content must be flaired.**

NSFW and NSFL is definitely not for everyone, but we'll allow it. You must flair it with either ""NSFW/NSFL Video"" or ""NSFW/NSFL GIF"". Filters to not see NSFW/NSFL content will come shortly. ",671742,False

**Guidelines and Information**

- Offensive jokes are fine as long as they are still jokes. We do make exceptions for extremely offensive jokes.
- Keep the comment section civil and light hearted.

These are jokes. Some of them are old, and as such reflect the tone of the times. Some of them are new, and just as offensive. Unless it's spam, it stays.

Did you see a gif that keeps getting funnier and funnier the longer you stare at it? This might be the right place to share it.

We recommend watching these gifs at work or some other place where you can't laugh for the best experience.

#Rules:
###1. Animated .gifs only
Flash animations, videos or websites are not allowed.
**.gifv links are explictely allowed and even preferred** if they are silent.
###2. Imgur, gfycat or reddit
All gifs must be hosted on imgur.com, gfycat.com or selfhosted on reddit, if you want to post a gif hosted on another site,  reupload it.
###3. Direct links please
Any links that don't end in .gif or .gifv will be automatically removed. The exception here are gifs on gfycat, which should look like: https://gfycat.com/ThreeRandomWords. Don't worry though, a bot will help you out with getting direct link to your .gif in case you make a little mistake.
If you can't get it to work, you can [contact the Moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBetterEveryLoop&subject=I%20can%27t%20get%20this%20gif%20past%20the%20AutoModerator).
###4. Self posts are meta posts
Self posts are for meta discussions only and must have [META] in their title. All other self posts will be deleted without warning.
###5. Don't Repost
[Use Karma Decay to check if you are reposting.](http://karmadecay.com/r/bettereveryloop) Also, search the subreddit for the title of your submission. If your gif (or a near exact duplicate) has been posted within the past 6 months or is in top posts of the year or all time
, don't post it again; there's no need for reposts within the same subreddit. If you see a repost, don't hesitate to report it. Don't get mad at reposter though (unless they're repeat offenders), there's no shame in accidentally reposting something, it happens to the best of us.
###6. No joke titles
It's okay to make your title funny, but this sub is about gifs, not texts. This also means no resubmitting the same gif with a different/better title.
###7. No trolls or hateful language
This is a subreddit to make people laugh, not to make them feel bad. this is based on mods discretion.

**Submission Rules**


**Please note: this is not r/oddlysatisfying or r/powerwashinggore. 

Power/pressure washing refers specifically to the use of a high-pressure water jet to clean surfaces. 

If you have to ask, 'does it count?' in the title, odds are that it does not. This includes art, gore, product posts, questions, and poor quality images/videos.

Non-power washing posts that are related to the same cleaning satisfaction are allowed on Wednesdays (defined as Wednesday US EST) only and must be appropriately tagged. These posts made on any other day or not tagged by the poster will be removed. Thank you.**


* All posts must include power washing in some form (i.e. gif, video, before and after, or washing in progress image).
* Every Wednesday posts not related to power washing will be allowed.
* Include some context in the title.
* Make sure your image is hosted by an [approved host](http://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/wiki/faq#wiki_this_is_my_first_time_submitting.2C_what_should_i_know.3F).
 * Original source **is allowed and preferred** over the approved hosts. If your submission is not on the list of approved hosts, but it is an original source, please use the tag **[OS]** so your submission is not removed in error. **[If your image is rehosted from another approved host it will be removed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PornOverlords/comments/t0o83/results_thread_rehost_rule_v2/)**
 * If you took the photo yourself, you can signify this by using the tag **[OC]** (*original content*) and after 24 hours you will be given special flair. If you don't receive flair after a few days feel free to message the mods.
* Regarding reposts: it is not a repost unless it was posted to /r/powerwashingporn less than three months ago, or if it's already in the [top 100 of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/top/) Reposts include screenshots from videos, same content different source, and different angles same incident.
* This is not r/powerwashinggore; if your post contains an example of poorly done powerwashing with lines or uneven markings all across the object, it will be removed.
* Phallic images or phrases or otherwise inappropriate writing in your powerwashing post (ex. Send nudes, tits, penis, etc.) will be removed.
* Any artistic imagery, writing, or similar must be flaired with the [SHITPOST] flair. This does not include posts that are not powerwashing; unrelated posts will be removed.
* Before and After pictures must be included in the same post. It is recommended both images are visible from Reddit and subscribers do not have to go to an external site to view all the content. 
* Adding the image resolution in brackets is preferred.
* If you have any questions check out the [**FAQ**](http://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/wiki/faq#).
* Please keep comments civil, we got a great thing going here.

##About

This subreddit is for pictures of innocent things that appear to be racist in a certain connotation. 

Some examples of what accidental racism could be are:

* Wording that came out wrong.
* Ironic pictures.
* Something that just didn't come out like expected.

##Rules and Regulations

***I.* No intentional racism!** Intentional racism and bigotry of any kind will be met with an immediate and permanent ban. 

***II.* Not just accidental racism:** Accidental sexism, or any other accidential -ism is also permitted. 

***III.* Crossposts and reposts:** Crossposting is allowed. Reposts from the last 90 days or the top 50 of all time are not. 

***IV.* No fakes or staged photos:** Content must be genuine; no photoshopped pictures or staged situations for karma. This ain't /r/4chan.  

***V.* NSFW content must be tagged.**

***VI.*Adhere to [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/).** Be civil, no doxxing, brigading, et cetera. 


***VII.* No complaining:** Do not complain that in some contexts the accidental racism is innocent or tenuous, or not actually racist. We know. It's accidental. Nothing here is actually racist. Leave that to /r/iamverysmart.

***VIII.* No critical race discussion posts:** The subject and study of critical race theory is a serious topic, however, this is not a serious subreddit. It's primarily a humor subreddit. In light of that, critical race discussions do not belong here. 

***IX.* Swastika posts.** In the Western world, specifically North America, swastikas are associated with Nazism, Neo-Nazism, and other offshoots. These posts are allowed. Items that are mildly swastika, or only kinda sorta look like one belong in /r/accidentalswastika or /r/mildlyswastika. 

***X.* No KKK or Negro posts.** Negro and KKK posts, there are a lot of these and there are no variations between the one and the other.

-------------------------
* For all participants, please practice proper Reddit [etiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

-------------

 If to take the photo the photographer got tangled up or did some acrobatics, stepped into a pool in the cold British winter, if the angle is different & refreshing, if you find the outcome extraordinary, appealing or overall simply a creation to be praised (Whether it's the art of the operator via filming or something else that the operator did) , this is the right place.

-----------

######*Guidelines* 

This is a sub for content documented by camera-wo/men/squirrel who are to be praised.

* Your Submission must be footage of something **you** actually want to see, Video or stills (not enough of [those](http://www.thomasshahan.com/#photos) here).

* Strive to find the original source & credit original content.

* Entertaining content isn't sufficient, there should be a reason to praise cameraman.

_____


###Stills are welcome but give credit (even if it's an Instagram username).
______

######**Rules** 


**Rule #1**: Pornographic, gore, harassment, possibly unwanted personal exposure, mean spirited content and the likes of which are unwelcome.

**Rule #2**: Hate speech & racism will result in an automatic permanent ban.

**Rule #3**: We do not support violence nor graphic content, this sub is PG-13.

**Rule #4** (4th in priority, really..): This is a subreddit meant for proper camera work, camera operation, camera placement, timing etc' not for cute dogs, not for interesting content, but for good, difficult, different, witty forms of capturing said content, although there are exceptions when the cameraman is acting in a way that is to be praised, like [[here]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PraiseTheCameraMan/comments/aeuv4n/all_the_camera_angles_on_how_this_is_happening/), praise the cameraman.

______________


A video must be filmed in a competent way, making it easy for viewers to pay attention to the video's content, examples:

1. Steady camera holding [(X)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FD4T1CHWg4)*

2. Zooming, using proper focus and or maintaining object in frame [(X-NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thd7ZqjclZE&t=1s)

3. Not ending the film too soon [(X)](https://imgur.com/bxTibgx)*

4. Filming vertically when s/he should [(X)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PraiseTheCameraMan/comments/8d99eu/that_zoom_in/)

*If the cameraman has done anything that is to be praised on its own, she doesn't have to be as good as a wedding photographer --to an extent.

Welcome to /r/AccidentalRenaissance, the subreddit that showcases photographs that inadvertently resemble well-composed Renaissance style art. 

&nbsp;


#**What does Accidental Renaissance mean?**	

What we mean by Accidental Renaissance is a photo that inadvertently (that is, NOT deliberately posed or set up) resembles a painting similar in composition, style, lighting, and/or subject to Renaissance-style art. 

We recognize there are many related art movements between the 14th and 19th centuries including: Baroque, Neo-classicism, and Romantic. All of these styles are appreciated and welcomed within this subreddit but please submit with flair indicating the style your submission/photo favors.

&nbsp;

###What an AccidentalRenaissance photo **IS**: 

* A photo that accidentally resembles the types of art popular from the 14th-19th centuries.
* **Composition**: Triangular/Pyramidial figures, Dynamic, assymetrical composition, foreshortening, and of course the use of the Fibonacci sequence or Golden Ratio
* **Lighting:** Featuring use of sfumato (blurring/softening of outlines) and/or chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and dark
* **Subject:** Landscapes, people, scenes, that feature one or both of the above. 

###What an AccidentalRenaissance photo is **NOT**: 

* A really cool photo of your favorite pet/child/sports team. 
* A photo of your drunk buddy or group of buddies.
* A random photo of a drunken fight.
* A pic of someone sleeping or passed out. 
* That popular photo making the rounds on Reddit.
* A super hilarious pic of a bunch of drunken people at a party, a bar, your basement, a concert. 
* A moody pic of the crowd at your favorite concert.
* A video or gif. 

&nbsp;

***We ask that you please read the following simple suggested rules prior to your submission:***

1. Each Renaissance-esque submission must be a direct image link and only be sourced from the [mod-approved site list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRenaissance/comments/5wfndk/approved_websites_for_submission/?ref=share&ref_source=link).

2. If the subject in reference to the post is deliberately posed, it is not considered accidental and shall be removed therefore by the moderator.

4. Creative and original titles resembling that of a labeled caption found in an art exhibition or museum are encouraged. For inspiration and assistance in your inventive title abilities, [visit The Louvre.](http://www.louvre.fr/en/departments/paintings/highlights?nrppage=50)


6. Subject to Removal: (there are exceptions to every rule and removals are at mods’ discretion:)

        Subject to Removal:
      * Photos featuring a **pet**
      * Photos containing any **text** overlay
      * Photos featuring a **baby or child**
      * Photos of **sporting events, sports, parties, or drunken brawls.**
      * Photos deemed **NSFL.**
      * Photos **promoting violence** or intended to incite flame wars or political controversies. 
      * **Stills of movies or games** or screenshots. 
      * **Reposts** of content from the past 12 months in this subreddit and/or the top 100 posts of all time.  (See [KarmaDecay](http://karmadecay.com) )

7.  Posts which retain less than 200 votes after 24 hours will be removed to reduce clutter from front page.	
	
8. Please use the report button for anything that you feel breaks the rules, and please [message the mods](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AccidentalRenaissance) with any concerns, constructive advice, or even positive feedback (?!) you may have. 
We want to make this community fun while also faithful to the subject matter. Thanks to all the users who have been faithful to this community, and stay classy!

&nbsp;

We implore you to familiarize yourself with the [official rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict user’s posting privileges as needed.

2vjvl,t5_2vjvl,ProRevenge,"Have a story of you or someone you know getting back at someone with pro revenge after being wronged? Post it here! 

[**Network of Retaliation Multireddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscalatingRevenge+GamersRevenge+OldSchoolRevenge+ProRevenge+myevilplan+pettyrevenge/)

**Rules:**

1. Your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way. In order for your story to be pro revenge, it should involve you going out of your way and going above and beyond to get revenge. If that isn't the case with your story, it may be better suited for another revenge subreddit such as /r/pettyrevenge or /r/maliciouscompliance.
 * Only revenge stories are allowed. If you have an idea for the subreddit, please message the mods to submit your suggestions. Meta posts may be allowed, but need to be cleared by the mods before posting.

2. The story does not have to be about you; it can be about someone you know or even something you saw somewhere else. However, stories must be feasibly possible. If the mods deem your post to be clearly fictional, it may be removed.

3. No posts asking for ideas of revenge, all posts should contain a full revenge story.

4. Do not post any personal information, real or fake, such as full names, phone numbers, addresses, facebook/twitter pages or email addresses etc. Posting personal information will result in an immediate ban.

5. Cross posts (x-posts) are welcome but please copy the text here, instead of providing a link. You may link to videos but your post will still need to describe the revenge (i.e. you can't just post the video link and nothing else).

6. Please, nothing too serious. No felonies or other nonacceptable/illegal stories. 

7. Bots and bot-like behavior are not allowed. 

8. Please be considerate in your posts and comments. No racism, sexism, personal attacks against other redditors etc. The mods may remove distasteful comments.

9. This sub is not your personal army. Do not attempt to use this sub to gang up on or promote a person, cause, or group.

10. Do not post comments calling stories fake without backing up your claims. You are more than welcome to point out inconsistencies or express your skepticism, but simply saying 'It didn't happen', 'fake', 'that happened', and the like do not contribute to the sub and create a toxic atmosphere.

The mods reserve the right to remove content at their discretion.

If you have any questions please feel free to message the mods.

#This is not about actual vacations to Disneyland or Disneyworld.

It's for weird, terrible, terrifying or bad illustrations from [WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page).

[(The origin of this subreddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/4ebt9v/just_another_wikihow_illustration/d1zh7yh/?context=2)

1. Find a weird/terrifying/hilariously bad picture from [WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page)
2. Post it here with an original and funny caption that meets our [captioning guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/wiki/captioning_guidelines)
3. Link to the WikiHow source article in the comments

**A note from the moderators:** If you are posting on mobile, please ensure the file extension of the image you are using is .jpeg or .jpg and NOT .jpg.webp . This is because the mobile image uploader has a predication to silently failing upon meeting the .webp image type.


#Rules:

1. All posts **must** be **unmodified** 'full' (non-mobile) WikiHow images or videos. They *should* be strange, terrifying or just plain awful. Exception: Images that can be captioned well without these failures.  [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/6xucb1/what_to_do_after_saying_bond_and_before_saying/).  Mod discretion.
2. All posts **must** provide the source WikiHow article as a link in the comments.  This should be done as either a plain link, or the link text should be the name of the article.
3. All posts **must** be captioned in a way that meets our [captioning guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/wiki/captioning_guidelines)
4. Don't be a dick.
5. Do not violate our [repost rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/wiki/repost_rules)
6. Meta posts (those which refer to subreddit internal discussion) must be flaired with the 'Meta' tag

You may also be interested in /r/notdisneyvacation for unedited weirdness.

#Rules

Hover over each rule for more detail.

 
|||
|:--|:--|
1. Don't link directly to posts. Redact all identifying information. | Take a screenshot and redact all identifying information, e.g. real names, usernames (including your own), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, addresses, license plates. DO NOT ASK FOR NAMES/USERNAMES.
2. Memes and image macros are not allowed. | Don't post memes, copypastas, or image macros (broadly defined as an image with text on it). This includes, but is not limited to, Snap Stories, Whisper, and ""background color"" Facebook statuses. **Posts that include someone pinging the name of this sub will be removed.** The only exception to this rule is if the focus of the post is a comment someone made about the meme.
3. Submissions of obvious trolls or jokes are not allowed. | Use common sense. 
4. Stuff that looks verysmart but isn't really. | This submission isn't really an example of some one trying to be “verysmart.” Common examples of things that look verysmart but aren’t really include: conspiracy theories, New Age woo, drug-induced posts, Donald Trump, ""sheeple,"" Neil deGrasse Tyson, Rick and Morty, etc.
5. Long posts: Highlight relevant parts. | Highlight relevant sections, or cut it down into an album. With videos, put excerpts in the comments.
6. No reposts. | Use the search function.
7. Make an effort with your title. | Titles should be at the very least descriptive of what is in the post, and ideally funny and/or interesting. Titles consisting of nothing more than ""Thought this belongs here"" or ""Found on [website]"" will be removed.
8. Submissions involving arguments are not allowed. | Posts cannot be part of an argument. This is to prevent people from using this subreddit to mock those they're debating with. We're looking for examples of people acting ""verysmart"" on their own without being baited into it. This rule applies whether you're involved in the argument or not.
9. Avoid anti-intellectualism | Don't post people explaining concepts, even in a way that seems pedantic. Having expertise in a subject or enjoying intellectual pursuits don't make someone ""verysmart."" This sub does not discourage learning or critical thinking.

310rm,t5_310rm,coolguides,"*Our sister subreddit /r/shittycoolguides is your place for your non-serious and comedy guides. They love that stuff over there.*

**Defining a Guide**

Guides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables.  It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.

**Defining An Infographic**

An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. 

**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**
These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.

***Subreddit Rules***

**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**

**2. Infographics will be removed.**

**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**

**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**

If you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!

Many of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.

Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments. ",590963,False

##[What is this place?](#icon-question-sign)

This is a subreddit dedicated to those gifs that just keep on giving. Whether they are mind expanding, funny, or just plain awesome, they are welcome here. 

In [the words](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/comments/6cflo5/these_taken_movies_are_getting_out_of_hand/dhucmt0/) of u/D-Shap ([paraphrased](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/comments/6cjrsb/just_to_clarify_this_is_gifsthatkeepongiving_not/dhv6w9a/) by u/mellamodj):

> r/gifsthatkeepongiving is generally for longer gifs that continue to provide entertainment throughout the gif's lengthy duration. 1 second gifs don't usually belong here because they give once, and then they replay. There is no opportunity for the gif to ""keep on giving.""

> r/Bettereveryloop is for shorter gifs that, when watched over and over again, get better every time.


##[What are the rules?](#icon-question-sign)



2. Gif must keep on giving. 

    Clearly. 
1. Use basic [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) 

2. Please submit the gif in .gifv form 

     a. Submit a direct link to the gif (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/OsdC58v.gifv), not like [this](http://imgur.com/OsdC58v)), and make sure that if the extension is .gif, change it to .gifv. This means that gif albums are not accepted either. Only pure gifs. 

3. Abstain from perfect loops unless they follow rule 1.

    a. ...and they just happen to be loops (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gzr56BN.gifv)). If you have perfect loops, please put them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bettereveryloop)

4. Please abstain from reposting, but x-posting is welcomed. However, when you x-post, please reference source in the title, and/or post the source in the comments

5. Don't sexualize the people in the gifs. 

6. Keep reposts to things that are older than a few weeks. If it is on the first few pages of the [new tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/new/), dont post it.

[The Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/5e2gsk/sbubby/)

A sbubby is a logo whose text has been edited cleanly, such that it resembles the original logo but reads something else. See [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/wiki/index) or [the KnowYourMeme entry](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sbubby) for more information.

[Yeah you like rules? Too bad mister, here you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/7huwnz/the_rules_as_plain_and_simple_as_possible/)

[Amended rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/922die/new_rules_new_mods/)

[Further amended rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/a9369h/subreddit_updates_and_common_repost_list/)

- Make sure you're posting a logo edit! This subreddit isn't a general all-catch for clean edits of any kind, it is a subreddit for just clean logo edits, and not all clean edits of all kinds.

- Authenticity! Try to make your sbubby look as close to the source logo as possible - while altering the text as much as you can. This means avoid altering the logo's imagery!

- Read the rules on r/ExpandDong before telling someone else that their post belongs there.

- Flair your posts appropriately! See all of the explanations for our flairs in the rules post above. 

- Tag your NSFW posts as NSFW.

- Please keep in mind ALL Sbubbies are allowed here, whether they are in [Eef Freef Spirit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/922die/new_rules_new_mods/) or not. 

- No reposting! This is against both subreddit rules AND Rediquette. If you see a repost, please report it (and link to the original post if you can).

- No [Loss](http://knowyourmeme.com/news/heres-to-loss-the-internets-greatest-meme) edits! Post these to /r/LossEdits instead!

- No [Despacito](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/despacito) edits! Post these to /r/despacito/ instead!
- No Big Chungus edits! These are often very low quality, and too common, and we're sick of seeing them!
- No [REEEEEEE](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee) or [similar](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/autistic-screeching) edits!

* Your title needs to somehow describe the post. ""Does this count"", ""My first sbubby"", ""Not sure if it fits here"", ""This belongs here"", ""Made this on my phone"", etc... and variants of such titles will be automatically removed.

* The resolution of your submission must be at least 420x640, anything less will be removed. This is done so that mobile readers won't have a difficult time seeing the posts.

* Watermarks should be barely visible and out of the way, and shouldn't draw more attention than the edit itself or distract from it.

Other subreddits:

/r/ExpandDong: For uncleanly-edited or low-quality logo text edits.

###Rules
####Only Terraria related content
* Keep it on-topic.

####English language only, follow the reddiquette and search before posting
* This is an English speaking community, all non-English posts and comments will be removed.
* Follow the reddiquette when posting and commenting (e.g. do not use FULLY CAPITALIZED WORDS).
* Please search the subreddit before posting, to avoid regularly asked questions and topics.

####No bad behavior
* Doxing (releasing personal information).
* Homophobia, sexism, racism or any other derogatory language.
* Purposefully inciting arguments.
* Personal attacks, harassment and threats.
* No explicit content, anything which is deemed NSFW will be removed.
Depending upon the severity of the offence a warning or instant ban may be given.

####Mark spoilers
- Rule applies to all of the content which was added in the latest update for the first 72 hours.
- Any posts which contain spoilers must use the “spoiler” flair.
- Do not include spoilers in the post title.
- [Refer to this page for more details, including how to use the flair system for posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/wiki/spoiler).

####Limit self-promotion
- Sharing of your own content is allowed, but it must follow the [reddit self-promotion rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

####No posting about the speculative release of updates and sales of the game
- Only the developers know when the game will next be updated (including date and time) and when the game will be on sale (including start date and price). In other words, questions only Re-Logic can answer will be removed.
Moderator discretion will be used to determine if there are any legitimately high-effort exceptions to this rule (i.e. Detailed post about things that might be included in a future patch)

####No begging, trading, or baiting for copies of the game.
* Do not beg for a copy of the game.
* Do not offer to trade for a copy of the game.
* Do not bait people into asking for a copy of the game (e.g. saying that you have an extra copy of the game).

####No low quality/effort submissions or images of text
- No low quality/effort submissions. This means a post with one sentence in the body is not acceptable. If it takes you less than 30 seconds to submit a post, chances are it qualifies as ""low-effort.""
- No ""I've played Terraria for __ hours"" posts will be allowed anymore. They don't gain enough attention to warrant keeping them around.
- Posts about achievements you've earned are allowed to a certain point. Moderator discretion will be used to determine which ones are low-effort and which ones are not.
- For more information about submission guidelines, reference the [submission guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/wiki/submission-guidelines) and the [submission infographic](https://i.imgur.com/JHTXoA3.png).

####No duplicate posts
- For submissions such as Tweets or blog posts duplicates will be removed, preserving the earliest.
- The decision on whether to keep a later post or to make a new one if it has a more appropriate or better title is at the discretion of the moderators.

####No piracy links or requests
- Discussion of piracy is allowed, however encouraging and giving information on how to pirate the game will not be tolerated.
- Anyone who provides links to pirated copies of the game will be banned immediately, without warning.

Welcome to r/EdgyMemes! Your number one source for edgy memes on Reddit! When posting please conform to our submission rules:

-**Rules**-

**1 - Edgy memes only**

This should go without saying, but we only allow edgy memes here. First offenders get a warning and repeat offenders get banned.

**2 - No brigading outside of offical meme wars**

Brigading is against Reddit Terms of Service and will not be tolerated here. Not listening to this will result in a **PERMANENT BAN**. This includes sharing your bans from subreddits, spreading memes from here onto subs that will obviously be inflammatory or encouraging others to do so. Seriously, there is no appealing this either. 

**3 - No asking for upvotes**

Do not ask for upvotes in either the meme itself or the title. Even if you're doing it as a joke

**4 - No Reposts/Stolen Memes**

We want to encourage OC memes, so reposting is heavily discouraged around here. This applies to memes from other subs, and reposting your own memes.

**5 - Don't put the joke in the title**

The meme needs to stand on its own. This doesn't exactly mean that the meme NEEDS to have captions, as some memes speak for themselves. This is up to interpretation by the mods

**6 - No videos**

No videos will be allowed to be posted here. ESPECIALLY videos of people dying, literally there's a sub for that.

**7 - No Social Media Screenshots**

This is basically any post that can be summed to be a screenshot of a social media post/comment, real or fake. These include anything from:

* Any text/instant messaging
* Discord
* Reddit posts/comments
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Youtube Comments
* Tumblr

*Please note that mods can also remove a meme at their own discretion if they believe it does not belong on the sub. Either if it's not a meme, there's no joke, or for any other reason.*",95897,False
2z166,t5_2z166,ANormalDayInRussia,"**Guidelines**

* Content doesn't have to be strictly Russia, your visualization of a normal day is good enough. We're here for laughs after all.

* Videos are good, but pics and gifs are better. Articles work well too.

* Help this subreddit grow by submitting content and spreading the word.

**Rules**

1. No Yakov Smirnoff - In Soviet /r/ANormalDayInRussia, post deletes you.
2. No ""Meanwhile, in Russia..."" It gets horribly overused here.
3. If a post is NSFW, please mark it NSFW. Don't ruin someone's day.
4. No NSFL content, there are plenty of other subs for Murder/Death content.
5. No photoshops or obviously fake content. Lets keep this realistic. There are other subs for that. 
6. Avoid reposting submissions. Please check the [top of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/anormaldayinrussia/top/?sort=top&t=all) and also search before submitting. 
7. No image macros / memes. 
8. Don't be cyka

#**PLEASE SEARCH THE SUBREDDIT BEFORE POSTING YOUR VIDEO** 

##  

* **Something to put you in a good mood.**

* **Videos and audio of people laughing infectiously. No context required**

* **Please tag Let's Play gaming videos with [Gaming] at the start of the post title**
* **Remember the youtube URLs may be different but link to the same video, so please search for the keywords too (laddergoat, U-Bahn etc.)**

* **Reposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.**

* **If the video is long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. [WikiHow on ways to do this with youtube.](http://www.wikihow.com/Link-to-a-Certain-Time-in-a-YouTube-Video) If it is not on youtube, include the appropriate time with your post title.**

* **[Warning: do not consume beverages whilst viewing videos in this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/comments/1pljy8/gta_5_online_hilarious_glitch_tow_truck_chain/cd3ldqv?context=1)**

* **[Mod Approved](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AMod%2BApproved) content**

* **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/wiki/index#wiki_faq)**


##Encouraged content:

1. **Videos or audio** of people laughing infectiously.

2. **Funny laughs** that make you join in.

3. **General rule of thumb:** If the video makes you laugh when you start it right after the funny event and before the laughter, it belongs here.

4. [**This Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeauvE1M7qc) is why this subreddit was created

5. **Link to the funny!** add (example):"" [t=1m52s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggB33d0BLcY&feature=youtu.be&t=1m52s) "" to the youtube URL to link directly to the relevant part of the video.


##Discouraged content:

1. [**Laddergoat**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggB33d0BLcY&feature=youtu.be&t=17s)- it's hilarious but it's been posted here enough times

2. Funny videos but **without laughing**.

3. **Jokes, memes, text, and photos**.

4. **Bad-natured laughs**, bullying, and victimisation. If it can only be hosted on Liveleak or WorldStar then it probably doesn't belong here.

5. Videos which do not have people laughing in them, there should be people laughing!





##Subreddit Rules:

1. This is a happy place. Be respectful.

2. Comments not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned. These may include; racist, homophobic, sexual comments, and general dickishness.

3. Bullying in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.

4. DO NOT spam your Youtube Channel here!

5. The report button is not a super downvote button. If you report, it really helps us mods if you send us a quick message as to why your reported.

6. Tag Let's Play/gaming videos "" [Gaming] "" at the start of the post title.

7. No political discussions! Let's keep this politics free. If you insist, you shall be either perma banned or temp banned.

8.  Videos with laughter edited in from another source will be removed.

9.  Videos must be at least 15-20 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.

#[Rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules)
Rule | Description
:--|:--
**Our Mission Statement** | [Clear rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules) that help give the subreddit a balance of content. -- In addition please follow [redditquette](/wiki/reddiquette) and reddit's site-wide [rules](/rules). 
**Spoiler Policy** | No spoilers in titles for 24 hours after a show has aired. -- If your post contains spoilers put the tag [SPOILERS] at the START of your title and the show title.
**Posts must be about wrestling**|""All link posts must be directly related to wrestling. Any link post not featuring wrestling itself, or in relation to a wrestling show or the wrestling industry, is subject to removal. 
**No image posts that are:** |memes/image macros i.e. an image with text on it done for comedic effect or with slight variation for the sake of a cheap laugh (if it can be found on /r/AdviceAnimals it doesn't belong here) or observations better suited to a text post.
**Don't reply as a new post** | If you want to fix someone's post, or have a better example of what's been posted, tell us so in the comments, not by making a new post!
**No spam** |Only link to your own content if you contribute to the community.
**Reposts and vague titles** | Obvious reposts and titles that are overly ambiguous will be deleted at the moderators' discretion. (e.g. ""This Guy"")
**No Low-Effort Content** | Low-effort, single image **link posts**, including but not limited to, screenshots, crude photoshops, and MS paint-style artwork, are subject to removal. However, these may be posted as a self post with a description of the content.
**No ""Plot""/Sexual Content** | Posts focused on sexual content will be removed. /r/WrestleWithThePlot and /r/WrestleWithThePackage are better places for this content.
**[Meta] posts** | Posts or submissions about the community itself are allowed as long as they follow the general rules of Squared Circle.
**Text posts** | A text post should have sufficient text in its body to either strengthen the title, create discussion or add more information. Any posts posted seemingly for no reason but to bait, troll, or otherwise antagonize the community can and will be removed at the mods discretion.
**No Fake News**  |/r/SquaredCircle has a very strict policy towards troll rumors (fake injury reports, releases, etc.) and those responsible for posting them are subject to being banned.
**Moderator Discretion** | At any time the moderators will use discretion on any given rule. If they feel it's significant or unique to be up despite the rules. On the other hand, they also reserve the right to remove any post they feel breaks the rules. All of this can of course be appealed by messaging us.

##**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

####Follow BustyPetite Guidelines

BustyPetite means a girl with a small frame (petite) who has proportionately larger tits (busty) in comparison to her frame. Don't get too caught up on it, but photos must make it clear that the girl isn't ""thick"".

Examples of rulebreakers:

 * [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/54IDRqe.jpg)
 * [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/VRCntiU.jpg)

**[Read the full body guidelines here](https://redd.it/9e5xvk)**

---

##**BustyPetite Rules**

###**Rule 1 - NO MINORS**
 * All models must be 18+
 * Posting underage content will result in a ban and you'll be reported

###**Rule 2 - NO X-POSTED OC**
 * **DO NOT** post other users' original content
 * If you see your content posted here and wish to have it removed, [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBustyPetite&subject=OC%20Removal%20Request) and we'll remove it

###**Rule 3 - NOT SUITABLE FOR \/r/BUSTYPETITE**
 * BustyPetite does not necessarily mean thicc/curvy. Please see [this handy guide for details](https://redd.it/9e5xvk)
 * If someone is petite but not busty enough, or busty but not petite enough, they are not suitable for the subreddit. We're looking for someone disproportionately busty but thin or fit.
 * This is obviously a subjective metric, so moderators may allow or remove content at their discretion

###**Rule 4 - NO NAMES**
 * Unless the model is a paid professional, mentioning names will be considered [doxxing](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/posting-someones-private-or-personal)
 * ""Names"" means **ALL** types of names:
  * First names (given names)
  * Last names (surnames)
  * Nicknames
  * Usernames

###**Rule 5 - NO PHOTOSHOP**
 * This includes morphs and excessive digital alteration of any kind

###**Rule 6 - NO LOW QUALITY IMAGES**
 * Low resolution and/or small images will be removed
 * Images shot with a potato will be removed

###**Rule 7 - NO REPOSTS**
 * Reposts from the [Top 100 of All Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/BustyPetite/top/?sort=top&t=all) in this sub will be removed. This list changes, so check it often
 * Recent reposts will be removed
 * When reporting reposts, please include a link to the most recent post

###**Rule 8 - NO COLLAGES**
 * Single scene images ONLY
 * This means:
  * No split-frame images
  * No photomontages
  * No multiple shots in a single image

###**Rule 9 - NO SPAM OR SELF-PROMOTION**
 * This includes watermarks
 * OC posters may use a username watermark to protect their content, but no personal subreddit/website/social media watermarks of any kind. Violators will be banned
 * Maximum of 5 posts per user every 24hrs

###**Rule 10 - DON'T BE A DICK**
 * Shitty comments will be removed

2sumw,t5_2sumw,britishproblems,"British spin on /r/firstworldproblems.

##Rules
1) No posts complaining about or pertaining to Reddit. Posts should apply to the outside world. Mod announcements, constructive criticisms and suggestions for improvements to /r/britishproblems must be tagged with [meta].

2) Problems must apply specifically to Brits and be British in nature. If your post could apply equally to someone from another country, or is about another country,  it most likely isn't a British problem and would be better suited to /r/firstworldproblems instead. 

3) Submission titles must contain the entire problem. Background information may be included within the self text. Don't just list something, explain why it's a problem.

4) No politics. Post to /r/ukpolitics instead. Problems involving politicians but not politics are fine. Comments involving politics will be removed without warning. 

5) No slurs or harassment. Extreme or repeat offenders are banned. Racism of any sort is not tolerated. If you feel you've been banned by mistake, please message the mods. 

6) Spam of any kind is not tolerated. This includes surveys, illegible comments, YouTube videos and adverts. If you wish to advertise please refer to [Reddit's helpful page on this matter](https://about.reddit.com/advertise/). Offenders will be banned without warning.  

[Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) also applies. 

Note: AutoMod has been set up to remove posts and comments from new users and those with low karma for review. If you feel your post(s) and/or comment(s) have been removed by mistake, please message the mods.

A few rules:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1\.**&nbsp; Don't be a dick.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**2\.**&nbsp; Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

&nbsp;&nbsp;**3\.**&nbsp; No spamming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**4\.**&nbsp; Help others create new SCPs by providing constructive criticism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**5\.**&nbsp; This is not an RP subreddit. Please try to keep roleplaying to a minimum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**6\.**&nbsp; Do not post about how to kill 682. Or beat 096, 173, etc. It's been done to death. [Try the search bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/search?q=scp+number+goes+here&sort=relevance&restrict_sr=on&t=all) if you have a question about a specific SCP. [[More Info]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18zof4/mod_post_we_need_to_have_a_talk_regarding_682_and/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;**7\.**&nbsp; SCP Fuel images can only be posted on Fridays, and a comment must provide a link to a source that is either CC by SA or Public Domain. Failure to do so will result in the post being removed. [You can use CC Search.org to find compatible images for these posts!](https://search.creativecommons.org/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;**8\.**&nbsp; Tip Of My Tongue (TOMT) requests for help finding the name of articles/tales you can't remember will be removed once answered. But first, try using the [Tag Search](http://www.scp-wiki.net/tag-search) on the wiki.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**9\.**&nbsp; If you're showing off content you've created and you also share a link to your Discord/Telegram/Kik etc. - that's completely fine. But posts just promoting SCP discussion groups/servers will be removed. [[More Info]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/1v8u4u/please_do_not_post_your_pet_project_wiki_until_it/)

&nbsp;**10\.** Posts about Keter brand shelving, or Euclid Street signs, or unrelated things looking like the SCP logo or acronym have been done many times and will be removed. [[More Info]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/3c9bvy/no_more_keter_brand_plastic_storage_whatever/) 

&nbsp;**11\.** No low-effort or low-quality posts. Low effort posts include ""we are leaking into [other subreddit]"" and ""found on [x]"" threads. Memes go on /r/DankMemesFromSite19/ unless it's Monday. Meme content on Mondays must be directly related to SCP - title/text captions alone isn't good enough. [[More Info]](https://redd.it/a8v42n)

&nbsp;**12\.** AMAs must be approved by the mods.

&nbsp;**13\.** *SCP: Containment Breach* related posts go on /r/scpcontainmentbreach

**NSFW Guidelines:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1\.**&nbsp; No porn, either submitted or in comments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**2\.**&nbsp; No extremely disturbing visual images or shock sites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**3\.**&nbsp; No excessive use of expletives.

/r/travel is a community about exploring the world. Your pictures, questions, stories, or any good content is welcome. 

Clickbait, spam, memes, ads, brochures, classifieds, surveys or [self-promotion](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) will be removed. 


**No politics** and keep it civil.

###Submission Guidelines

1. [**Read the FAQ** and search before posting](/r/travel/wiki/index). Avoid repetitive questions. Search the subreddit to see if topics have been covered already. Check our **[destinations of the week](/r/travel/wiki/topic-of-the-week)** page for country and city tips.

2. [Include a **descriptive title**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_use_descriptive_titles). One or two word titles rarely provide enough information. Include the country/region.

3. If submitting an image or video **include context** - [read this section of the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/faq#wiki_.22here_are_my_holiday_photos.21.22). No quotes, selfies, or other clichés: we're not your facebook.

4. Be **[as specific as possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_give_specifics)**: where you're starting, dates of travel, budget, interests, places you've been, things you like and dislike. Visa and passport questions: **state your country of citizenship**.

5. **Check [Google](https://www.google.com)** before posting.

6. **[Present the research](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_show_what_you.27ve_already_found)** you've already done so we don't feel like we're doing everything for you; we are not your travel agents.

7. **Stay around** to answer questions or respond to comments. This applies to all questions, image, and blog posts.

8. **[Low-effort posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_avoid_low_effort_posts)** (""Peru: tell me everything!"", ""Where should I go?"") will be removed without further notice.

396ym,t5_396ym,WeWantPlates,"**A Few House Rules**

**I**. Above all, please be civil. This means no personal insults or attacks. You will get one warning only.

**II**. If posting an image from an external site you must link to that site, and give credit to said site, in your thread title. This includes Twitter, in which case you should also include the original poster's Twitter handle.

**III**. Submissions must be dishes which were served at a place of business. They needn't have been served to you, but if they were please include the name and location of the establishment.

**IV**. Things that you found interesting but that may not necessarily fit the *We Want Plates* mantra of ""this should really be on a plate"" **are** allowed. These posts are moderated on a post-by-post basis. Mod decisions are final.

**V**. The purpose of this sub is to showcase cringe-worthy examples of plating. Please bear this in mind when submitting content. There is no need to submit burgers on boards, sushi on sushi boats or traditional types of plating from other cultures.

**VI**. If you post the Avolatte, you will be banned.

2tcpq,t5_2tcpq,ainbow,"1. 

A free area for the discussion of issues facing those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and all other sexual or nonsexual orientations and/or gender identities. Post links to articles, self-posts, photographs, experiences and whatever else is important to your experience of queer life. We encourage you to treat others with respect, start and/or engage in robust discussion and interact with the community. The more we know each other, the better we'll get along. 

# Like chat? Use Discord? #

**[Join the /r/ainbow discord here!](https://discord.gg/FvRqqCg)**

# Want flair? #

Get it up top ⇧ by clicking the (edit) button!    
Don't know the flags? We have these available: 

* [](/ainbow) Rainbow flag
* [](/trans) Transgender flag
* [](/bi) Bisexual flag
* [](/ace) Asexual flag
* [](/genderqueer) Genderqueer/androgynous flag
* [](/pan) Pansexual flag
* [](/ally) Ally flag

In the box below the flag grid, you can set custom text for your flair! You can put whatever you like; explain what the flag means to you, tell us where you're from, what you like, whatever! Note: if someone hasn't specified custom text, you won't see anything by their flag. 

We also have spliced versions of the trans and genderqueer flags (thanks, WTFcannuck!), for those with dual citizenship. Choose whatever flag feels right; this isn't an ID card, it's just a fun way to show your colors.

Want these flags on your subreddit? They're open source! Check out the [/r/ainbow flair on github](https://github.com/josecastillo/r-ainbow-flags/).

# A note on moderation #

This subreddit is lightly moderated. The community actively self-moderates offensive comments with downvotes, but comments are generally not removed except for violations of site-wide guidelines and as outlined below. If you prefer a more hands-on approach, try /r/lgbt. /r/lgbt requires trigger warnings, and removes comments and users for violations of their rules, which are detailed in their FAQ.

This subreddit is a free speech zone (although gratuitous eye candy is specifically discouraged). It is also lightly moderated, which means that it's up to you the community to downvote offensive posts and comments, and upvote constructive content. Please use your voting and posting powers to create the community you want to see.

NOTE: Comments and/or posts that threaten violence (including threats of self-harm, which will be reported to the admins immediately), incite violence, expose personal information about others without their consent, or contain illegal content **will** be removed.  Please use the ""report"" button on only these types of posts. Contact the moderators if a post/comment has been removed in error.

As of July 2015 we are piloting a new guideline; until we have more precise language, please don't be an asshole. Free expression can only happen when everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute, and behaviors that disempower and silence do more to create an echo chamber than even the heavy-handedest of moderator actions. If you are acting like an asshole to a member of this community, the moderators reserve the right to extend a seven-day temporary ban as a cooling off measure.
***
**TL;DR**:
Report posts that are low effort trolls, homophobic/transphobic, extremely NSFW posts, brigades, discord/chat links, advertisements, spam, and surveys without a moderator comment on them.

**Rules (hover for more info):**

Rule | Desc
---|---
**１ - No reposts.** | *Offenders will be banned. Repeated offenders will be permabanned. If you intend on posting something, make sure that it has not already been posted here. We recommend that you don't post things you found off of other places, nine times out of ten it will have originated here and thus be considered a repost, we want OC only. It doesn't matter if it's a ""different fry"", if it's unoriginal, then it's a repost. When reporting a repost, please link to the original post*
**２ - No asking for upvotes.** | *Posts asking for upvotes in the title and/or in the meme is not allowed.*
**３ - Don't post pictures with no text.** | *Pictures with text are better. Straight up pictures with a filter will LIKELY be removed.*
**４ - Don't put the punchline in title.** | *The meme must hold its own.*
**５ - No politics.** | *This is not a place for politics. Political memes are not welcome here.*
**６ - Don't post memes made by /u/DeepFryBot.** | *Posting memes generated by /u/DeepFryBot is a bannable offense. DON'T EVEN TRY, MATE.*
**７ - No ""Lazily fried"" memes.** | *Memes that can be considered lightly/lazily fried or nuked may be removed. You shouldn't just add one filter of noise, but you shouldn't add 10,000 filters of everything either. This is /r/DeepFriedMemes, not r/sauteedmemes or /r/nukedmemes.

Hello everyone, 

this is DeTrashed, this sub is committed to cleaning up the environment one can at a time.  Please post anything related to picking up trash. Any thing from picking up a bottle while walking your dog in the morning, cleaning up a campsite or even organizing a clean up event. 

Remember although this sub was started on just picking up trash and cleaning the environment, it is so much more. Please share anything that involves taking an active step to improve the earth. So cleaning up trash, recycling, removing invasive species, green improvements on your house, and etc. Be creative!

Keep in mind the main point of this sub isn't about bragging (although you are allowed to) it is about encouraging others to help out and get involved. Although some people may say our actions alone don't make much of a difference, when there is an entire sub reddit dedicated to it and encouraging others, then yes we do make a difference!

To everyone who has been spreading this sub by mentioning it in threads and such, THANK YOU very much. this sub has grown much more than I ever thought it would. please keep it up and continue to encourage other

* Reposts are allowed, please tag all reposts with the correct flair. You can check to see if your post is a repost [here.](http://karmadecay.com/r/theocho?url=ref) However recent reposts or reposts from the top 100 will still be removed at the moderators discretion. 

* Posts need to be a competitive sport. In most cases the activity should have the following: Rules, scoring, record keeping and a condition for winning. Trick shot or high skill content outside of a competitive setting should go in /r/toptalent or somesuch. 

* Parody and comedy content is allowed. Please note such posts with the [Parody] tag.

* Popular and well known sports will be removed, these sports likely have their own subreddit so post your content there instead. Sports that are well-known only to one country can still be considered Ocho material, generally these should be tagged with the [Traditional] flair. Moderators will have the final say on whether a sport is 'ocho' enough for the subreddit or not.

* A world record or world record attempt does not automatically make a post Ocho material. In many cases, while they *are* trying to beat someone else’s score, they're not *actively competing* with them. For example, a video of the world record for longest time on a pogostick would not be Ocho material. However a video of a competition between multiple people on pogosticks, where the person who stayed on the longest and placed 1st happened to break the world record would definitely be allowed.

2x93b,t5_2x93b,oddlysatisfying,"###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does ""Oddly Satisfying"" mean?
We are forever searching for a ""true definition"". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* ""oddly satisfying"" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as ""2048"", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (""Say it, don't show it.""). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
Do not repost content that has been submitted to this subreddit within the last **2 months** or content that is in the **top 100 posts** of all time. When you report posts, **please include a link to the original version of the post.**


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as ""My..."", ""Mine..."", ""Our..."", ""We..."", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing & ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments & Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is ""Oddly Satisfying"" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

3k32c,t5_3k32c,bigboye,"###A subreddit for large wild animals behaving like domestic pets. 
After all, they're really good boys deep down! Let the conflicting feelings of cuteness and fear take over you. 

###DISCLAIMER:
Wild animals are not pets and require very specialized care when taken in by humans. We try to ensure that every post here comes from a legitimate sanctuary, wildlife preserve, or zoo. If you see a post from somewhere that doesn't practice proper care please **message the mods** and we will remove it given that you **PROVIDE PROOF** of insufficient care. 


#####Rules: 
1. **No animals that are commonly domesticated.*** No cats, dogs, or other common housepets. 

2. **Animals must be LARGE!** We don't call it B I G B O Y E here for nothing. We're looking for affectionate giants here! Wild animals that have a domestic counterpart (cats, reptiles, birds, etc.) must be substantially larger than that counterpart. All posts are subject to moderator discretion. 


3. **Animals must be displaying cat/dog-like behavior.** Before posting, please ask yourself ""Would a dog/cat/other common domestic animal behave this way?"" If the answer is no, your post doesn't belong in r/bigboye. 


4. **Reposts:** No reposts from the last 3 months and no reposts from [the top 50 all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigboye/top/?sort=top&t=all). Frequent reposts will also be removed at the discretion of the mods.

5. **NO content from the Black Jaguar White Tiger Foundation.** BJWT posts will be deleted without warning. Information about their inhumane practices can be found [here](http://911animalabuse.com/black-jaguar-white-tiger/).


6. **PLEASE BE KIND!!** This is a sub for giant warm fuzzies. Please treat each other with respect!

*Horses and cows are okay as long as they are playing like cats and dogs. Horses being pet or eating out of a human's hand don't really fit because this is typical horse interaction/behavior.

Submissions should include spaces that are purposefully designed and assembled, with the intent of capturing the aesthetics of the room. Please share your inspiration in creating your space and why it holds meaning and significance to you. The more detail you include, the more there will be to talk about! 

[Please read the Reddiquette Guide before posting to this or ANY subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)


ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST INCLUDE A LOCATION IN THE TITLE OR THEY WILL BE REMOVED.

Original content only. Sharing content you found online will result in automatic suspension.

This is a ""ROOM"" sharing sub. There are to be NO PEOPLE in your image. Pets are allowed, provided they are not the primary focus of the photo and not included in the title.

Creativity is highly encouraged! In both your content and post title. **Post titles must be factual and opinion-free.**

Occasionally, links will get mistakenly flagged as spam. If you post something valid and it doesn't show up, please ""mod message"" us and it will be fixed.

PLEASE NO DESIGN HELP REQUESTS! If you need help designing a room, please go to [r/DesignMyRoom](http://reddit.com/r/designmyroom). Once you are finished with your room, come back here and post photos of the results.

This also means NO WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP) posts. Only rooms that are completely finished/ready to share.

NO LINKS TO SPONSORED CONTENT OF ANY KIND.

RUDE, IMMATURE, PETTY, RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC RESPONSES WILL RESULT IN BEING SUSPENDED. THE LENGTH OF TIME WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE SEVERITY OF YOUR COMMENT.

NO DOXXING COMMENTS!!!

Doxxing is what it is called when you use information given online to find out further personal information about a poster. When people ask/give out the specific locations (like building names/streets/specific landmarks) you are basically giving the OP's exact location to the internet and that is NOT acceptable.
Asking neighborhoods is fine. If the OP wants to answer, that is his or her choice. But comments that just say exact locations will be removed and repeat offenders will be banned.

3eszy,t5_3eszy,me_ira,"Welcome to me_ira!

Very few rules to worry about, moderation will be pretty hands off. With that said please take note of the following:

1. **All posts should be kept within the humorous / meme spirit of the sub and not get too serious. Keep it lighthearted! Post titles are encouraged to follow the me_ira format but this is no longer mandatory.** 
* The correct replacement for ""me too thanks"" on this sub is ""Tiocfaidh ár lá""
* Reposts will be moderated to a degree. Please refrain from reposting posts made in the past month or two. There reposts will be removed at the moderators discretion, based on the length of time from the repost, the amount of attention the original post got, etc.
* This sub is a circle jerk, so don't get caught up in politics too much. Comments will however usually be left unmoderated if good discussion happens, unless they get **out of control**.
* Posts about all republican paramilitaries and their allies overseas welcome.

""Out of control"" means:

* Racism
* Sexism
* Ableism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia
* Unironic Religious Bigotry
* Fascists
* Rape Apology
* Imperialism Apology

This sub is a meme sub. Jokes about the Brits are allowed and encouraged, but **actual unironic racism won't be tolerated.** 

Now have fun out there comrades!

2tja6,t5_2tja6,terriblefacebookmemes,"This is your reference for all those horrible memes your relatives share on facebook. Dont be fooled by the name though, regardless of where the meme comes from, as long as its in the terrible meme spirit, we want to see it!

This is not a subreddit for showcasing satirical or ironical memes, only the lowest of the low memes that are bad in an unintentional way.

#**These rules have been recently updated and revised. Please take the time to sift through them and understand before posting or commenting to avoid sanctions.**

* Always make sure any and all personal or traceable information is censored or cropped out of your post. Any post found to be violating this rule will be removed without notice.

* Please keep your posts on topic. Avoid posting memes that are ""Dank"" or deepfried for example. We only memes that were made without the intention of being terrible, but that are just so by nature.

* In an effort to keep the content as fresh and as entertaining as possible, please do not repost and use tools such as [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/) to ensure you aren't posting an overused washed up meme. Repeat offenders will be banned.

* **SATIRE AND POSTS MADE IRONICALLY ARE NO LONGER PERMITTED.** Any satirical post will be removed on site. This also includes posts made to be intentionally terrible.

* Make sure your NSFW posts are tagged appropriately.

* Do not witch hunt or incite witch hunting.

* Remain respectful and polite to others. The themes of some of our content can sometimes spark heated debates, and while we are against censorship, we'd also like to remind all of you that we live in a common ground, and that respect is the basis of our coexistance. Extended debates will be removed, and political siding should stay at a minimum.

#Rules
  
Rules| |description
:--|-:|:--
 1. Be civil| | Don't be a jerk. Treat fellow posters with respect. Don't attack others over differences of opinion. You may disagree, but there's no reason to not be civil about it.  No bigotry. Sexist, racist, and homophobic remarks have no place here. Attacking someone with hate speech of any kind is grounds for an instant, permanent, indisputable ban.
 2. Stay on-topic| |Content must be related to Batman or Batman-affiliated characters and stories, whether it may pertain to the comics, films, television shows, or video games. Posts with the explicit intention to push an agenda or political belief will be removed at moderator's discretion.
 3. No spam| |*""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account.""* This is not a sub for advertisement. You may not post links to websites, blogs, or channels that you're affiliated with unless you are an active member of the community. Please see Reddit's policies on [spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F) and [self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for more details.  
 4. Excerpts, clips, and artwork must be sourced| |Submissions of comic panels must include the title (and preferably issue #) in the title.  Submissions of video clips or screengrabs must include the name of the movie or TV show.  Submissions of artwork should either credit the artist, or link directly to the artist's site.  
 5. No piracy| |Do not ask for pirated material.  Do not post links to piracy websites. Do not submit content that displays a link or watermark of a piracy website.
 6. Spoilers must be marked| |Movie spoilers must be marked for 3 months after its release. Comic book spoilers must be marked for 2 moths after its release. TV spoilers must be marked for 1 month after its release. For spoilers in text, use this spoiler markup: \[spoiler text](/spoilers ""Bruce Wayne is Batman"")
 7. No low-effort posts| |Low effort posts may include:  Memes or image macros of content that do not use Batman.  Screenshots of social media. Photo manipulations or video edits that do not drastically alter the original. Pictures of merchandise, without any indication of effort put behind presentation. Petitions. Pictures or news links of celebrities that don't relate to Batman. Other posts that the moderator team may deem low-quality, and not conducive to discussion  
 8. Avoid reposts| |Content (such as comic excerpts or video clips) that has already been posted in the past 3 months, or is among the top 25 posts of all time, will be removed. An article pertaining to previously-posted news will be removed, unless it is the original source, or if it adds additional content not seen in the previous link.

2xjsv,t5_2xjsv,TheDepthsBelow,">We are a subreddit dedicated to showcasing the strange, creepy, and horrifying things that exist just below the surface of the water. If it seems like something that just shouldn't be found in the oceans, lakes, or rivers of the world, then this is where it belongs.

> Happy swimming, and remember- There's always something below you.

> We have a [Discord channel!](https://discord.gg/013E7mCH5ltc1GIsS) Why? Just because. Come hang out, talk about whatever.

---

># RULES:

> 1. Submissions can be real or realistic fiction- realistic fiction meaning pictures or stories of things that could be.

>    Please, no monsters or other things like that, we'd like to keep it as convincing as possible if you choose to post fictitious items.

> 2. Obviously, NSFW tags are in play. If there's bodies or gore of any kind, please be considerate.

> 3. Practice good reddiquette. We don't need a bunch of nonsense clogging up the comment threads.

> 4. [This picture](https://i.imgur.com/DFpVyBo.jpg), [this picture](https://i.redd.it/irpgkicc29gy.jpg), and [this one](https://i.imgur.com/WjHwBOe.jpg) will get you a week long ban. Seriously, we're all tired of baby feet, rays, and shops.

> 5. NO POLITICS. End of story, no discussion. As to why this rule was finally invoked, ***someone*** decided that this was a good place to drag political nonsense into. There's plenty of other places for you to scream into the void about your political opinions on Reddit, this is *NOT* one of them. I don't care what ""side"" you're on, keep it to yourself or you're out.

> 6. Everyone other than the user who caused Rule #5 to go live, Keep being awesome!

> That's it. Six simple rules to follow.

**Everything related to The Simpsons!** Check out /r/SimpsonsShitposting if that's your thing. 

*(Images, videos, quotes, news, articles, thoughts, trivia, etc.)*

Note: The Simpsons have made fun of politics pretty much since its inception and there will be political posts from time to time because of that. 

# Rules and Guidelines

* **Pay close attention to [the rules & guidelines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQR-cPXlmY)**
* Please use spoiler tags when necessary:`[X Kills Y](/spoiler)`, ex: [X Kills Y](/spoiler).  
* Hate that it has to be said, but personal attacks, racism, slurs, etc are not allowed and will lead to a ban. Let's just laugh at the Simpsons.

>###Subreddit Rules

1. **Block out names and other identifying information.** Blurred out names are often still readable, so be sure to block them out completely. 

2. While the name of this sub is /r/indianpeoplefacebook, you are encouraged to post screenshots of all sorts of non-English speaking facebook users, not only Indians.

4. Please be respectful, follow reddit's site-wide rules and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). 

5. We urge you to upload English language content, as the overwhelming majority of redditors only speak English. When a screenshot is not in English, please add a translation in the original image. 

6. Please refrain from posting satire or anything mean-spirited.  Posts spreading stereotypes will be removed and you may be banned. **This includes sexually suggestive creepypms**, and any content that was created to make racist jokes or mock people.[*More info here.* ](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/comments/7723oi/lpt_dont_break_the_rules_or_the_evil_mods_might/)

**For strange comments by people with wholesome usernames go to /r/uh_oh_spaghettios**

**For strange comments by people with strange usernames go to /r/cursed_usernames.** 

* **Rule Uno: Usernames will not be in the title.**
 
* **Rule Dos: The username must be inappropriate or weird, as this is subjective it will be up to the mods and users to decide if it is allowed.**

* **Rule Tres: In the comments of each post you must link the original comment.**

* **Rule Cuatro: No racism, bigotry, misogyny, etc. from users on this sub. However the username you are screenshotting can have these things. Basically keep these things out of the comments.**

* **Rule Cinco: User's comment/post must be wholesome. Now here’s a little clarification. Wholesome doesn’t simply mean a nice comment, it means something genuine and heartfelt.**

37zh6,t5_37zh6,beholdthemasterrace,"**Rules:**

* **Don’t make us work to figure out if it’s Behold material.** Look at the top posts, read the sidebar, please.

* **Don’t tell people to kill themselves or suggest people be killed.** Why does this need to be said? Why do people think it’s OK to say it? We don’t know.

* **This is not an anti-white sub** (most of us are as white as Miracle Whip on white bread), it’s not an anti-Drumpf sub, it’s not just an anti-Nazi sub (it *is* an anti-Nazi sub, oh yes, but also anti-Klan, anti-alt-right, and anti-anyone who thinks their “race” is superior). 

* **Something about somebody being racist is not sufficient.** They have to display their lack of supremacy in the post itself. Racists and bigots suck and suck hard and are only that way because they are cowardly losers with nothing positive in their lives, but “hey, look, a person being racist” posts will be removed. A fat, sobbing, racist who got fired because he tweeted racist bullshit, now that’s Behold material.

* **Kekistan flag, MAGA hat, etc** these things are insufficient alone. There are plenty of places to mock knuckleheads, let’s keep our focus on real supremacists.

* Shocking that this needs to be said, **but absolutely no fucking racist revisionism, support for racist ideology, apologism, or any of that revolting bullshit.** This will get you banned. See also, **don’t be an asshole**. Just to break it down, if you are a nazi, you are also an asshole, QED. Not going to go digging into your post history and banning you based on what you say in other subs, but if you bring that reeking crap in here, out you fucking go. There are plenty of outlets for your weak-ass insecurity on reddit already, not to mention outside of it. In case it’s not apparent, low tolerance for racist bullshit.

* **Don’t be an asshole** unless it's directed at Nazis, the KKK, the Alt-Right and other such inherently superior people.

* **Mocking white supremacists is not racist, you knucklehead**. The mockery is not about making fun of white people (there are subs for that) but making fun of WHITE SUPREMACISTS (and other supremacists, equal opportunity mockery, honestly). Get mod reports about this shit. Really?

* **Also, while pictures of the mango mussolini seem like good targets, I don’t want to see them on this sub.** Fuck that guy. Sure he’s racist and a massive asshole, he just dog-whistles his bigotry. Plus there’s lots of subs about fuck the cheeto benito. We do love seeing video of his smoking hot wife slap his pudgy, short-fingered hand away. But not on this sub, please.

* **Don’t link to racists’ sites**, because fuck them, not sending traffic their way.

* **Reposts suck**: winners don’t repost. If you see it before a mod does, put the link of the original post in the report for faster processing.

***Free Speech***

**[AMENDMENT I](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992#131)** Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

But that doesn’t mean free speech has no consequences—play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

#Rules and Guidelines  

##SUBMISSIONS      

***hover for details***

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1) Content must actually make you rage. |No rage comics, memes, or obnoxious like/share stuff. No pics of bad parking jobs. No screenshots of computer problems. Nothing that mildly annoys you. Nothing that physically disgusts you (no NSFL content). This is not /r/mildlyinfuriating, /r/firstworldproblems, /r/terriblefacebookmemes, or /r/wtf. If your post fits in any of those subs, it doesn't belong here. |  
|2) **Do not post any identifiable information.** Block out all names & usernames from your post. | This includes Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, Instagram accounts, Deviant Art accounts, Reddit accounts, etc. Failure to do so **will result in a ban.** |  
|3) Social media screenshots and videos must be of **notable public figures**: Politicians, celebrities, online personalities, etc.| Exceptions: 1) If your post has been shared by a substantial number of people (eg. 1000+ re-tweets/likes/upvotes) then it will be allowed. 2) If your post features a large collection of individual comments all featuring a similar viewpoint (eg. 30 comments all saying the Paris attacks were a false-flag) then it will be allowed. |
|4) No **manufacturing outrage.**| Do not present opposing articles or pieces of information to show some sort of contrast. Do not include things such as ""imagine if the gender/race were reversed!"" If the content does not stand on its own, it does not belong. |
|5) If posting an **article or video**, your title must **match the original title**, or provide an accurate description.| Editorializing content is not allowed and will result in the removal of your submission. This includes if you post a screencap of an article. |
|6) This is not your personal soapbox. Posts promoting an agenda will be removed.| We are not your personal army, nor are we interested in your ideology. If it's clear your interests in posting here involve drumming up support or outrage, your post will be removed regardless if it meets the other requirements. |
|7) Links to reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Deviantart, Instagram, Soundcloud, Vocaroo, etc are **not** allowed.| These links often contain personally identifiable information. If possible, take a screenshot of the content, **censor any names/usernames/identifying information,** and then post it. |
|8) Content focusing on the actions of the mentally ill or disabled people is not permitted **and you will be banned.** | This is common human decency. |
|9) Images must be directly linked and hosted on a reliable host. | URL needs to end in .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. |
|10) No mobile links. | Delete the ""m."" or ""mobile."" in the link before you submit.
|11) All posts must be from recent news | We are not interested in rage bait that happened last year.  If your content isn't from the past month or so, don't post it

# Our Rules
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^If ^you ^have  ^questions ^about ^a ^rule, ^you   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^can ^view ^a ^detailed ^breakdown ^[here](/r/dbz/wiki/rules).  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^New ^submissions ^are ^reviewed ^before  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^approval ^and ^may ^not ^show ^up ^immediately.

1. **Posting Etiquette**  
Be nice to each other! Don't be needlessly antagonistic or confrontational.   
&nbsp;  
Don't [spam](/r/dbz/wiki/rules). Self-promotion is sometimes permitted, but only with [permission from staff](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdbz).
2. **Prohibited Topics**  
NSFW content. Piracy.  
Low-effort posts. [Memes.](/r/ningen)  
Politics. ""DBZTubers"".  
Quizzes, polls and petitions.  
Buying & selling. [Versus threads  
and strength debates.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/) AMVs.  
Gameplay videos.  
&nbsp;  
Screenshots, clips, panels, soundtracks, or official artwork must  
be submitted as part of a text post.

3. **Submission Guidelines**  
Submissions must be directly related to Dragon Ball. If your post requires a title to make it relevant, it doesn't belong here.  
&nbsp;  
Merch should only be submitted on [Merch Mondays.](https://redd.it/ault8u) Otherwise submit to r/dbzcu.  
Fanart and cosplay must be image submissions, and the artist(s) must be credited in the title. Self-created artwork must be finished & link any references used in the comments. ""Original"" DB characters are not allowed. You may not submit fanart more than once a week.

Spoilers for the current chapter of the *Dragon Ball Super* manga must be tagged at all times outside of dedicated threads. When creating a topic to discuss those spoilers, put a warning in the title, and keep the title itself spoiler free. *Dragon Ball Super* spoilers are otherwise allowed except in DUB episode discussion threads.   
&nbsp;  
To hide a spoiler, format your  
comment as so:  &nbsp;  
`>!spoiler!<` 

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^We ^reserve ^the ^right ^to ^remove  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;^submissions  ^at ^our ^discretion.

#### Rules
[Full rules »](/r/DDLC/w/rules)

* **Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and be civil and respectful at all times.**  

1. **Content:**

    a. Keep submissions related to DDLC and Team Salvato projects. The post must be related beyond the title.

    b. [Common posts](/r/ddlc/w/commonposts), low-quality posts, or an excessive amount of posts by the same user will be removed. [Roleplay accounts are under additional restrictions on their activity in /r/DDLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/wiki/rpaccounts).

    c. Do not submit image based posts on [No-Pics Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/wiki/npt) or otherwise violate the NPT posting restrictions.

    d. [Always flair your posts.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/368890752463274005/513150476712148995/unknown.png) To flair posts on mobile, post a comment in the format flair: <flair name, without spaces and all lower-case>, for example flair: ocfanart. Tag NSFW posts and spoilers for DDLC or other forms of media appropriately.

2. Tag spoilers for DDLC mods and non-DDLC media. Format non-DDLC spoiler titles like:  
[*Source*] Spoiler-free title

3. **Fanart:**

    a. **Attribute the artist in the title and give [a direct link to the source page](http://redd.it/8ca9ex) for all submissions using fanart.** In addition, traced or edited image submissions ***must*** attribute the original source(s). ""Fun"" posts using fan-made artwork must still follow this rule *unless* they are following a well-known meme template.

    b. **Flair edits as ""Edited Media.""** Non-DDLC art must have substantial edits made to it.

4. Do not post pirated content or content that violates the [IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/). Respect others' intellectual property.

5. No content of a sexually explicit nature, pornographic intent, overly fetishistic nature, or including excessive gore. Sexually explicit content should be posted in /r/DDLCRule34.

6. Do not repost content that has been posted within the last three months, or that is in the top 200 posts. Reposts must be of equal or better quality to the original post. You may only repost the same submission once.

7. Do not make posts advertising your community without [permission from the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fddlc&amp;subject=Advertising%20Post%20Approval). Do not self-promote excessively.

8. Posts about sensitive topics such as suicidal thoughts, self harm issues etc. must be tagged with an appropriate trigger warning, and triggering language must not be used in the title. Users in particularly dangerous or critical situations may still be redirected to other, more appropriate places should the moderators decide it to be the safest option for all. We recommend that at-risk users see our [Mental Health resources page](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/wiki/mentalhealth).

* **Appealing Moderator Decisions**: If you have questions or concerns about a post removal, account ban, or other moderator action, you can contact us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDDLC). Posts on /r/DDLC about these will be removed.

Post floofy animals. Non-cat floofs are welcome too!

Your chubby short-hair pets are cute and all, but we're more for longhaired animals here. Try /r/DelightfullyChubby instead!

No animal abuse or dead animals.

Please source images you find online.

Fake or misidentified animals will be removed. Feel free to repost with the correct ID though.

Be respectful. Don't post things degrading to women, people of color, cultural minorities, those with disabilities, and gender and sexual minorities.

2zhxd,t5_2zhxd,holdmycatnip,"/r/holdmybeer: catnip edition!

**Guidelines:**    

1. Post cats doing weird and interesting things, or making poor decisions that could be the result of their undeniable love of catnip.      

2. Animated gifs, gyphys, or videos are very, *VERY* preferred.  Still images will very likely be removed.  The best posts should also have a clever or funny caption, because I get bored and would like something to laugh at.      

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. 

4. Cats must remain alive, and relatively undamaged. Extreme feline embarrassment is, of course, hilarious.

5. Reposts are fine, if more than 8 months have elapsed, and as long as you use an interesting and/or funnier new title.      

6. Mindless *Cat., Cat., Cat.,* chains are strongly forbidden, because we think they're stupid and will not be tolerated here.  Brutal reprisals and/or banning may result. *(Added: 3/13/16)*       

7. There are other rules, but they are far too bewildering to list here.  You'll just have to trust meow. (No Instagram, Twitter)

397x6,t5_397x6,COMPLETEANARCHY,"Welcome to /r/COMPLETEANARCHY, the coolest refuge of anarchism on reddit!

/r/COMPLETEANARCHY is a low energy circlejerk. This subreddit was designed to be a place where (left and post-left) anarchists could circle jerk and make hilarious, relatable memes, and generally not have to deal with the shit that goes on in the rest of reddit (As well as Tankies and ***Liberalism***). Though geared for anarchists, all communists, socialists, labor organizers, or revolutionaries will be welcome and encouraged to just chill out and shitpost

However, there are just a few rules. They are very simple, no:

* Use of language which perpetuates any form of destructive hierarchy such as sexism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia, racism, etc.

* Being needlessly rude or excessively argue with other flavors of socialism (Take it to /r/DebateAnarchism or something please). This also extends to excessive agitation or toxic behavior toward other socialists. We're all comrades, don't escalate the name-calling into something worse than petty insults. And this rule also extends to capitalists here to argue. This is not a Debate sub.

* Advocacy, systematization with, or otherwise holding the viewpoint of any fascist tendency. Frozen peaches are for liberals and fascists.

* Linking to other subreddits without a no participation URL with the intent of starting a fight or brigading. Calling for brigades is also not allowed.

* Authoritarian Apologia. All Reactionary humor (inc. gulag 'jokes') associated with these figure will not be tolerated.

* Fascists. They will be banned.

* Debating socialists. This is a meme sub for socialists, not liberals and reactionaries. If you come here to argue, you will be banned.

* Inciting Violence against a particular group of people, or particular person. No calls to violence.

* Primitivists. Tacit approval of genocide is a no-go.

* Gender Critical Feminists or TERFs. Banned on sight.

Also, notes:

* please for the love of God use an /s to indicate sarcasm

* This is not a debate sub. If you try and debate with our users who come here not to deal with your bullshit, prepare to be banned

Rule-breakers will be subject to communally decided upon punishment to be administered by fascist, hypocritical mods.

More than anything, just have fun talking with your fellow insurrectionary comrades, it's a hard life in the alienating world of capitalism and we'd like you all to have a safe place to blow off some steam and have some laughs. We also have a [discord](https://discord.gg/WDTXB8k) Make sure you have a posting history on leftist subreddits. Sorry lurker comrades.

Read before posting!
===============

1. Submissions must be something you saw that was odd and out of the ordinary for your work setting. Only original content is acceptable. Do not post pictures taken by others.  Automotive and Non-automotive mechanical failure/oddities ONLY. 

2. Posts need not be automotive related, but must follow rule 1.

3. This is not a place to ask for help troubleshooting your vehicles issues. You can instead post these to our sister subreddit: /r/MechanicAdvice. Posts of this nature will be removed.

4. If it's not obvious, please include a detailed description of what the problem is or what the thing in the picture does/is supposed to do.

5. No memes or rage comics. 

6. Do not link photos from Facebook.  If you have a photo from FB you want to post, upload it into [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) then post from there.  Linking from FB causes security issues for the persons profile.

7. Please mark pictures with blood/gore/sexually natured as NSFW.

8. Please cover or remove license plate numbers, VINs, phone numbers, and names.

9. Do not post a ""spotted picture"" /r/Spotted,  /r/JRITSlounge, or /r/SeenOnTheStreet  are the proper places for those posts. Any offending posts will be deleted, this rule will be enforced with extreme prejudice. 

10. Discussions and questions that promote discussion are allowed, but questions cannot be of an /r/MechanicAdvice nature.  For example, ""What is the worst customer experience you've had?"" is allowed while ""What's wrong with my car?"" is not.  

11. Absolutely no sale site posts.  This includes Craigslist, Ebay, Facebook sale groups, etc.  For more explanation, see rule 1. 

12. Trend posts or ""karma trains"" will be regulated at the discretion of the moderators, as they often lead to rule breaking when they get out of hand. 

--> If you do not see your submitted post in ""new"" within 5 minutes, message the mods with the URL to your submission and we can fish it out of the spam filter for you.

# Rules

- If you see any posts that violate any of the rules, please report the post and message the mods a link to it

1. Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. Comments should contribute to **thoughtful and serious discussion only**.

2. **Refrain from promoting hate speech, racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, and any other abusive/threatening language.** ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature. Even if the person you are insulting committed a heinous act, do not describe how they should be punished if given the chance. Keep it in /r/justiceporn.

3. **Do not post content that is already in the [top 50 posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/top/).** You can check for reposts from your posts page [here]( http://karmadecay.com/r/humansbeingbros?url=ref). Recent reposts will also be removed. Reposts within 3 months of each other will be removed.

4. If you submit a post that has already been reposted **more than 3 times, your post will get removed**.

5. If your post is NSFW, please label it as such.

6. Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, **but please no spam. This means no posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc.** Such posts will be removed and reported. 

7. No memes or comics.

8. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans, do not make posts which require you to add context for the bro behavior to be understood. Moderators will remove such posts at their discretion.

9. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.

*Moderators reserve the right to remove content they deem harmful to the sub.*

1. Subjects must have appeared on a site with an 18 U.S.C. § 2257 or similar statement. The post doesn't have to be from an adult site, but the person _in_ the post must have appeared on one.

2. Must be cute / no normie-ass porn.

 A post must evoke something more than your average girly pic. Ideally the audience will think, ""Fuck, she's cute.""

 This is admittedly subjective, and on top of it, we moderate submissions strictly. Most don't get approved. Apologies in advance if yours doesn't. Think of us less like moderators and more like editors of a high quality smut magazine.

 We go into even more detail about what we think is cute in the [**FAQ**](https://old.reddit.com/r/TooCuteForPorn/wiki/faq).

4. NSFW is not a requirement.

If the post is not quite cute but is still somehow _wholesome_, you can try r/WholesomePorn.

***
# [New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)
***
#**.gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format submissions only, please!**
***
**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifsthatendtoosoon) and report the problem if necessary.**

------------------

#""The Spirit of the Sub""
If you've been on this sub a while, you've probably heard this term before. /r/gifsthatendtoosoon is a subreddit for gifs that stop before the story does, NOT spliced gifs. Since late 2016 we've been trying to cut down these spliced gifs. A gif that would fit the spirit of the sub really puts someone on the edge of their seat and is NOT just a gif that's trimmed before the climax.
***
#Rules

1. **Please try not to repost.** Cross-posting is allowed and encouraged but a reference to the originating subreddit is required in your post title. However, please make sure that the submission is still a direct link, and not a link to the original post.

 
   ***Format example: [xpost /r/subredditname].***

    If you are unsure of whether your gif has been posted before please use **[karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/)** to check.



2. **Direct image links are REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed. Your submission must be a single animated image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** If submitting a video, Streamable links are acceptable.

4. **Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are allowed.** ***THESE POSTS MUST BE TAGGED AS [NSFW] and use of either the PORN or GORE flairs is encouraged.*** Failure to comply will result in removal of post and a potential ban.

3. **No witch-hunts or brigading in posts or comments.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments.  

5. **Titles should be descriptive or punny.** Do not make submissions with the title ""This"" or ""Wait for it"" etc.

6. **No hate speech of any kind in posts or comments.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  
  
 *Making fun of or belittling any person or people based on race, sex, gender, sexual preference, disability, or other characteristics is likely to get you banned. Language that goes past the standard ""internet tough guy"" banter may result in a removal or ban, depending on the severity.*

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** Any posts or comments violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) will be removed and proper reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

2snxj,t5_2snxj,CrazyIdeas,"Create super hobos? Elaborate. Invisible spiders? Why not? There are ***no*** wrong ideas!

##Rules:

1. Don't be a dick

2. Submit original, interesting ideas. Sense, rationality, possibility and ethics are for sissies.

3. If the entire purpose of the idea is the setup for a pun, it doesn't belong here.

	3.1. As a rule of thumb, if your idea ends in ""call it ___"", it's probably a bad idea.

	3.2. If an idea stands on its own as an interesting, crazy idea without the pun, submit it. Add the pun in 
	the comments or maybe in the description if you really want to.

4. Posts shouldn't be for the sole purpose of complaining about a certain thing rather than add an alternative.

	4.1. Examples are ""vote for Donald Trump"" or ""shut down Fox News"". It's not a crazy idea, it's just being
	a dick.

	4.2. This goes for everything of the sort. No political bias here (we hope).

5. Awesome ideas are just as welcome here as well. Anything is possible, anything you think about can work in
your imagination. So don't comment saying ""this belongs in /r/AwesomeIdeas!"", we love you and accept you.

6. Please keep the circle jerk politics post to a minimum.

7. Some ideas are definitely more common than others. Use the search bar to see if it's been done before.

	7.1. ""Hold a special Olympics where everyone takes drugs!""

	7.2. ""Put all prisoners/politicians in an arena and make them fight to the death!""

	7.3. Literally anything to do with April Fools Day. If it involves April 1st, chances are you can remove
	the April 1st bit and it'd be just as valid.

	7.4. ""For just one day, swap these two subreddits!""

8. Tag NSFW posts as NSFW.

2qjii,t5_2qjii,socialism,"#Welcome to /r/socialism


**Socialism as a political system** is defined by democratic and social control of the means of production by the workers for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit, based fundamentally on the abolition of private property relations.

**Socialism is also a sociopolitical movement** dedicated to the critique and dismantling of exploitative structures, including economic, gendered, ethnic oppression.

Socialism, as a movement, confronts these different systems of oppression as mutually conditioning, intersectional, and/or dialectically related within the current hegemonic order. It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided.

We look forward to your participation in our sub, but please be mindful of our posting guidelines.

Keep meta posts constructive. Avoid shitposting. This is not a sub for sharing other user's post histories or for sharing screenshots of ridiculous things liberals say.

No linking to /r/Socialism in brigade subs or participating in subs that [harass our users](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/52uciz/mod_psa_users_of_left_wing_harassment_subs_will/).

/r/Socialism is *a sub for socialists*, and a certain level of knowledge about socialism is expected. If you are derailing discussions or promoting non-socialist positions, your comments may be removed, and you may receive a warning or a ban. If you are not a Socialist but are learning about it, *be polite*, or you will be banned for trolling. 
**Low effort images:** powerful expressions of socialism are always welcomed in r/socialism. Expressions may vary including pictures, cartoons, comics, illustrations, and even memes. However, those expressions which lack quality (does not clearly shows a socialistic construct), or has low-quality insights (possibly for karma and/or upvotes) may not be posted. Other subreddits like r/latestagecapitalism and r/fullcommunism provide a broader allowance of such images, but r/socialism aims to facilitate more impactful viewpoints and expressions surrounding socialism. Thus, those images that do not meet these quality standards will be removed.

[Follow this guide](/r/curvy/comments/14pbx6/the_motherfucking_super_simple_rcurvy_guide_to/) if you don't know how.

**NEED TO GET VERIFIED?** 

[To verify yourself. Information can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/curvy/wiki/verification)

-----------------------------------------------------

**JUST A FEW RULES** 

**All posts must be tagged properly** If you are a self-poster (OC), you must use the ""OC"" tag. Improper tagging may result in a ban. [More info on tagging here](https://www.reddit.com/r/curvy/comments/ag5ab1/all_posts_will_now_require_the_appropriate_tag_in/).

**You are not the Curve Police.** One person's curvy, is another's not-so-curvy. Respect and accept your differences and instead let your votes be your voice. Not being tolerant of another's point of view is banworthy behavior.

**Low quality posts** will be removed at the mod's discretion. 

**Zero tolerance policy toward trolls, jerks, assholes** and anyone making rude comments to anyone. If you see anything like that [please send a message about it to the mods](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcurvy). 

**No spam** or links sites with tons of ads/little content. If possible, please host images using [imgur](http://imgur.com) instead of linking to ad heavy sites. 

**Disrespect of the Mods** will not be tolerated and may result in a ban.

**Hardcore content is allowed.** Pictures, GIFs, videos, whatever it's all good.

**Subtle morphs (shops) are allowed.** These submissions do need to be marked accordingly. Over-the-top morphs will be removed at the mod's discretion.

**All posts are tagged as NSFW.** This is the default setting for *all* NSFW subreddit submissions. Get over it. 

**Reposts are fine**  as long as enough time has elapsed since the last time it was posted. That being said, fresh content is always preferred over old conetnt.

**No GoneWild pics here if you're not the Original Poster**

-----------------------------------------------------

**REPORTS** 

Reports are generally ignored because 99% of the time people are just wasting our time with false reports, expressions of personal opinion etc. However, if a posts gets more than 3 reports, we will look into it. If you have a real issue with a particular post, please message the mods directly and we'll investigate further.

##Subreddit Rules

This is a TL;DR of the most important rules of r/deadbydaylight. For more information, please visit the full and detailed rules on the wiki.

1. **Be respectful towards other users.**
> Wheaton's law: don't be a dick. Don't harass, threaten, insult or shame other users. Don't flamebait or troll. Hate speech is not tolerated.

2. **Unrelated Content**
> This prohibits posts about games similar to Dead by Daylight, general gaming surveys/questionnaires and offtopic memes. Simply relating to the game via the title is not sufficient. 

3. **Shaming other players**
> /r/deadbydaylight is not a platform to shame other players. Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light, and no calls to action against another player.

4. **Dead by Daylight's End User Licence Agreement (EULA)**
> Don't encourage or enable breaking the EULA. This includes advertising hacks, cheats and exploits as well as sharing ressources for how to hack or cheat (websites, guides, content creators).

5. **Buying, selling and trading of any kind is prohibited.**
> This includes keys and/or codes for the game, downloadable content and exclusive cosmetic (e.g. Street Meg). Begging is not allowed.  

6. **Support Posts** 
> No bug reports, technical support posts, ban appeals or LFG posts. If you wish to report a bug or get technical help, please use the appropriate weekly threads or report them in the [official Dead by Daylight forum](http://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/). Use /r/dbdLFG for 'looking for group' posts.

7. **Spam**
> Spam posts are zero-effort posts that are either automatically removed or flagged as spam. This includes empty self-posts, flooding, unapproved advertising and excessive self-promotion.

8. **Oversaturated Content**
> We define Oversaturated Content as common, old and uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit. Examples: salty messages of any kind, screenshots highlighting various Iridescent Emblems or various disconnects, the ""Killer who looks like a survivor"" fan concept etc pp. [Click here for a detailed list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_8._oversaturated_content)

* Creepy PMs FAQ
* **What is Creepy PMs?**
* CreepyPMs is a subreddit for posting creepy, inappropriate, bizarre, awkward, or offensive PMs. Consider everything here to be adult material, and possibly triggering. 
* CreepyPMs is also a [**support sub**](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/wiki/reasoning), a safe space for people who have been creeped on. That means comments that are not conducive to a supportive and positive environment may be removed, even if they don't violate the rules.

* **What kind of community is /r/creepyPMs?**
* We are feminist and women-friendly. You don't have to identify as such, but you must be respectful of the environment. Low-substance humor and stale hivemind circlejerks are not welcome.

* **Is it OK to share personal anecdotes and stories?**
* Yes, especially if they are relevant to the post. However, our rules still apply. If your story defends or supports the creep, derails the discussion, or isn't empathetic towards the recipient of the messages, it will be removed. Questions regarding whether or not you come off as creepy should be directed to /r/relationships.

##Welcome to /r/lostredditors! This subreddit is for posting screenshots of people forgetting what sub they're on or people misinterpreting the purpose of the sub they're on.

###Looking for a certain subreddit? Go to /r/findareddit!

#Rules:

**1\.** Only post people who are lost. A person posting nazi propaganda in /r/aww is not ""lost."" A spammer trying to sell t-shirts on /r/funny is not ""lost."" However, if a post contains well-executed ""trolling"", it won't be removed. Lostlostredditor posts are allowed, but they must abide by this guideline. In addition, low-quality lostlostredditor posts will be removed. This rule is put into place for purposes of keeping the quality of posts on this subreddit high.

**2\.** Show context in your posts. One should be able to tell that the user is lost just by looking at the screenshot. Screenshots must include both the lost redditor and some indication of what subreddit they are lost on.

**3\.**

* a. All posts must be of relevant content (i.e. redditors who forget what subreddit they are on or misinterpret the purpose of a subreddit). /r/findareddit is that way for those of you looking for a certain kind of sub.

* b. Do not pretend to be ""lost"" on this subreddit by making random irrelevant posts. Violation of this rule may result in a ban.

**4\.** Only post redditors who are lost. Not people on other sites.

**5\.** This sub is for people who forgot what sub they're on. Not redditors who are lost in real life. If you are actually lost, try posting to the subreddit for the area you are lost in.

**6\.** Be excellent to each other. Don't go over-the-top when cracking jokes. 

**7\.** Do not link to the lost redditor via crosspost or link post. Please post a screenshot instead. Linking to the lostredditor in the comments is fine, but the use of np links are strongly encouraged.

**8\.** No reposting from the top 50 of all time.

####*Moderators reserve the right to remove any content they deem harmful to the sub.*

If you are wondering about the name of this subreddit. Nuclear Revenge is simply metaphorical. Resulting to the use of nuclear weapons would be a pretty extreme form of retaliation. And we are looking for some serious retaliation stories. But please keep these rules in mind when submitting a story.

Rules:

1. True Stories Only - Any story that is submitted must be true. If it is determined to not be true, it will be removed.

***
**HardcoreAww is for CUTE & DANGEROUS animals that would KILL you if they had the chance!**

We value all life on the planet and agree that humans have been stripping away the natural habitats of the amazing beasts that we have demonized for our own expansion purposes. We post images of these creatures not only to make your heart go *aww* but also to highlight the importance of protecting them for the next generations to come.

***

**SUBMISSION RULES**

**Do not post:**

* Anything showing signs of humans or the human world without an original source - [more details](/r/hardcoreaww/wiki/index#wiki_anything_that_shows_signs_of_the_human_world) or see below ""Signs of the human world"".

* ""X-Post from"" in the title.

* Animals that aren't lethal (eg. fox, wolverine, lynx, snow leopard) - [list of killers](/r/hardcoreaww/wiki/index#wiki_animals_that_aren.27t_lethal) or cite examples.

* Gore (animal eating bloody things, injuries). 

* Dead animals (taxidermy, hunting trophy).

* Images with captions (memes, image macros).

* Content from Facebook, Flickr, or other personal social media accounts. Use [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) instead!

* Anything against [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette)! When possible, credit the original source!

Moderators reserve the right to remove post or comment at their own discretion.

**[Click Here for Detailed Rules & FAQs](/r/hardcoreaww/wiki/index#wiki_explanation_of_the_rules)**

**SIGNS OF THE HUMAN WORLD** 

If you are posting anything that shows the above, please add a comment in the post, eg. Zoologist Kevin Richardson interacting with wildlife, and a link to an original source, ie. photographer's page or information page to the actual image of the animal you posted.

***

**TAKE A STAND AGAINST EXOTIC PET OWNERSHIP!** 

*Keeping wild and exotic animals as pets threatens public health and safety as well as animal welfare. Wild animals can attack, they can spread disease, and the average pet owner cannot provide the care they need in captivity. Help us keep wild animals protected and in the wild!*

##**What is social anxiety?**


##### [](#h5)
>""Social anxiety is the fear of social situations that involve interaction with other people. You could say social anxiety is the fear and anxiety of being negatively judged and evaluated by other people.  It is a pervasive disorder and causes anxiety and fear in most all areas of a person's life.  It is chronic because it does not go away on its own."" *- from socialphobia.org*

##### [](#h5)
>""Social anxiety is the fear of interaction with other people that brings on self-consciousness, feelings of being negatively judged and evaluated, and, as a result, leads to avoidance. Social anxiety is the fear of being judged and evaluated negatively by other people, leading to feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, embarrassment, humiliation, and depression. If a person usually becomes (irrationally) anxious in social situations, but seems better when they are alone, then ""social anxiety"" may be the problem."" *- from socialanxietyinstitute.org*

##Subreddit Rules
##### [](#h5)
>**See a post or comment breaking the rules? Please hit ""report"" instead of replying, thanks!**

> **Rule 1:** Posts must be directly related to social anxiety.
Video posts should be clearly about social anxiety or an explanation must be included about why you think it has to do with social anxiety.

> **Rule 2:** Play nice. Remember the human, don't be intentionally rude, start a flame war, insult others, or troll. No sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, etc. These will result in your comment being removed and possibly a ban depending on severity. No ""incel-like"" behaviour, pro-rape, or general sexist views. Users reported of sending creepy / threatening PMs will be banned immediately and reported to the Reddit admins.

> **Rule 3:** No **posts** about personal Kik / Discord / Whatsapp groups. We cannot moderate every single chat that is linked and verify that it is fair. Join the official r/SocialAnxiety discord using the link above!

> **Rule 4:** Personal views and beliefs: Posts linking to /r/nofap or other ""miracle anxiety solving"" subreddits or websites may be removed. Users constantly linking them in the comments may be banned.
Religion is not an answer to everyone - if a poster mentions they are another religion to you or atheist then respect their view. Constant commenting like ""have you considered finding God?"" may result in a ban.
No posts encouraging drug/alcohol use to minors. Comments may be removed and users may be banned.

> **Rule 5:** No self-promo: Self-promoting your paid book / paid app / paid therapy services will result in an instant ban. Free / ad-supported apps or ebooks will result in a warning and constant self-promotion a ban. Personal blogs will be removed. YouTube channels are OK as long as the content meets these rules and the videos are relevant. Users posting surveys must consult the mods first - they must not ask for personal information and be on an approved website such as Strawpoll or Google Forms.

> **Rule 6:** No personal info: No links to personal facebook / twitter / instagram / etc. Doxxing will get you banned and reported to the reddit admins.",153551,False

##**What is /r/streetwear?** 

---
We are a community of fashion enthusiasts who aim to express our individuality and show off our style through streetwear, a fashion movement that combines elements of countercultures around the world with modern street style. Popular influences streetwear draws upon include, but are not limited to:

-   Youth subcultures like Skate or Goth
-   Artistic movements such as punk, grunge, and hip hop
-   Anachronistic artistic motifs such as cyberpunk or Renaissance art
-   High fashion and avant gardism
-   Active-wear such as athletic or military clothing

Users here are encouraged to show off their latest outfits and pickups, and engage in discussion about fashion and streetwear culture.

3ovsj,t5_3ovsj,TheMonkeysPaw,"Do you ever wish for things without thinking through them first? Do you ever struggle with finding the downsides of your hopes and dreams? Well, whatever the case may be TheMonkeysPaw is at your service!

Simply submit your wish and wait for other users to dissect and point out its flaws. Hopefully, by using this subreddit, your wishing skills will become foolproof.

If that doesn't make any sense, here's an [explanation by Prismo from Adventure Time](https://youtu.be/yrWAwdR9SSI)


This subreddit is based and named after the short story by W. W. Jacobs. If you are a major TMP enthusiast and want to talk about the short story, we advise that you take discussion like such to a more suitable subreddit. In any case, you can read the original story [here](https://americanliterature.com/author/w-w-jacobs/short-story/the-monkeys-paw), or listen to it [here](https://librivox.org/search?title=The+Monkey%27s+Paw&author=JACOBS&reader=&keywords=&genre_id=0&status=all&project_type=either&recorded_language=&sort_order=catalog_date&search_page=1&search_form=advanced).


**RULES FOR SUBMISSION:**

1. All post titles must begin with: ""I wish____""

2. No Images. All submissions must be text-based wishes.

3. No Harassment or Discrimination

4. No personal information

5. Any wishes that are even remotely NSFW must be labeled as such.

6. You may insert ""[Inv]"" before your post title if you would like to make an inverse post, where you state a **condition** and commenters reply with an accompanying **wish**. Here is an example of an Inverse post [(Credit to /u/Sortient)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/73o0rq/idea_you_post_a_potential_problem_and_people_give/dnrrele/):
>**TITLE:** [Inv] It only works on Sundays
>
>**COMMENT:** I wish I could instantly teleport to Chick-Fil-A whenever I want to.

7. Add the ""Explanations"" flair on your wish if you would like to make an explanation post. These posts are for the commenters to instead offer an explanation of how the wish could come true. If you want, treat these almost like something out of r/WritingPrompts—have fun with them!

8. Flair ""Side-Effects"" if you are okay with your commenters going crazy with outlandish side-effects or anything that goes against Commenting Rule #8.

8. Title your post with ""[M]"" at the beginning if you want to make a meta/discussion post about the subreddit itself. Improvements, complaints, advice—stuff that would be helpful for me or other users. I'll be checking these, so if you want me to improve the subreddit, these will be your friend.

10. No meta-posts that aren't discussion-related (seen above). This includes posts about the subreddit, or posts involving their upvotes or comments.

**RULES FOR COMMENTING:**

1. No Harassment or Discrimination

2. No personal information

3. Your comments dissecting the wish must be grounded in some way—nothing nonsensical.

4. You **MAY** twist OP's wish given word choice or context, like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/73ntr1/i_want_to_be_able_to_turn_invisible_at_will/dnrrwo3/).

5. Your comment may explain how the wish comes to be, but make sure to add the negative outcome as well. If the post is flaired with ""Explanations,"" you don't necessarily have to provide negative outcomes—those are mainly for prose-based answers.

6. You **MUST** comment with a wish on Inverse posts.

7. Try and be creative. ""The government will take notice"" is a bit overused, so try and think of something different.

8. Your comments shouldn't be adding random side-effects to the wish. For example, if someone wishes for world peace, don't comment something like ""the entire ant population dies out,"" because that's not related or connected at all. However, if the post is flaired with ""Side-Effects"" feel free to go crazy with hilarious side-effects.

#3.  **NO HARASSING/DEROGATORY/DEMEANING COMMENTS**
 * If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it
 * Sometimes, we are lucky to have lady Redditors share pictures of themselves with us. If you say anything offensive to them, you will be banned immediately.
 * If you see anything like this, please report it to us.

#4. **NO SPAM OR SELF PROMOTION**
This includes (but is not limited to):

[This](https://theoutline.com/post/7083/the-magical-thinking-of-guys-who-love-logic) is a fantastic explanation of the right-wing anti-intellectuals we mock on this sub.

Rules:

**1. Be Nice To One Another**

While relentless mockery and ridicule of certain conservative pseudo-intellectuals is most certainly allowed, make sure you be civil to one another. This means racial, homophobic, and transphobic slurs, harassment, threatening behavior, doxxing, and general assholishness.

**2. Low Quality Posts**

While this is a shitpost subreddit, we ~~pride ourselves on~~ *theoretically have* a certain amount of decorum. Pictures of a glow-eyed Ben Shapiro with the title ""When someone says 'feelings'"", are not to be tolerated, and will be removed.

**3. Staying On Topic/Spam**

This subreddit is dedicated to the mockery of Turning Point USA and conservative pseudointellectualism. We are not a subreddit about toilet paper. Posts and comments of this or any such off topic nonsense will be removed.

**4. Moderator Discretion**

The moderators retain the ability to remove posts and/or ban users if they feel it will improve the overall quality of the subreddit. Looking at you, T_D.

**5. Calls To Action**

This sub is lighthearted in nature, and is not the place for organizing political action outside of the general theme of the sub (ie. shitting on TPUSA). The reason for this is that activism based around a sub not designed for it tends to fail and take the sub down with it. We strongly encourage you to take part in leftist activism, just not here.

**6. Don't be a Fascist**

If you walk into a public place and take a big shit on the floor, you're going to get escorted out. For the same reason, we aren't obligated to entertain bad faith right-wing arguments.

Your ""free speech"" routine won't work here- the only freedom the right cares about is their own, and we're all very aware of it.

###Rules

 **1. Not extinct.** 

Content posted here should involve some form of life which no longer exists.

 **2. Not metal.** 

Flowery, fluffy and otherwise beautiful content will be removed.

 **3. Reposts.** 

Any content resubmitted within 60 days will be removed. This includes different pictures of the same content such as museum displays.

 **4. Politics.**

No politics, race, nationality, religion, gender, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. These topics will be removed.

 **5. Shitposts.** 

Shitposting gets you ripped in half by a pair of t-rexes.

3kvtt,t5_3kvtt,IncelTears,"IncelTears is a place for folks to submit screenshots (NOT direct links) of crazy stuff posted by self-described incels (involuntary celibates) wherein they blame women, their genes, their canthal tilts, their parents, romantically successful men, feminism, modern technology, and ultimately all of society for their own failure to get laid. We laugh at, cringe at, and discuss the never ending stream of hateful, idiotic, misogynistic, jaw-dropping, fallacious or just plain stupid things that incels post online.

This subreddit does not condone blanket hatred of virgins or the romantically unsuccessful, only those who self-identify with the hate label of ""incel"". Insulting people who are merely dateless, depressed, lonely, or involuntary virgins is not permitted here. 

Occasional discussion, requests for advice and support, and meta posts are welcome, but are not the focus of the subreddit. Therefore, their posting is subject to the moderators' discretion. Note that we do not have a Discord or a Facebook page.

==================================

**RULES -- IGNORE THESE AT YOUR OWN PERIL:**

**1) Abide by Reddit's sitewide rules.**

Reddit's account and community policy can be found [here.](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-are-rules) Content is prohibited if it: is illegal; is involuntary pornography; is sexual or suggestive content involving minors; encourages or incites violence; threatens, harasses, or bullies or encourages others to do so; contains personal and confidential information, impersonates someone in a misleading or deceptive manner; is spam.

**2) No encouraging suicide or violence.**

If you want help please call a local suicide hotline. In the USA, help can be found here or at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

**3) No username posting and avoid direct links.**

Except your own, do not post screenshots that show usernames. Do not direct link to other subs. See rule 5.

**4) We are inclusive, but we do not tolerate intolerance.**

This sub takes an inclusive and welcoming view of choices regarding consensual sexual practices, whether that's polyamory or remaining a virgin. Negative generalizations about all women, all men, all transpeople, race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., are not welcome. Try to avoid generalizations about incels. Sexualization of minors and/or any pedophilia support/apology will result in a permanent ban. Encouraging the blackpill, the redpill or toxic and hateful ideologies is not allowed either.

**5) Do not link to hostiles sites or subreddits. Do not brigade other subs.**

Do not directly link to threads or comments (Braincels, MaleForeverAlone, MGTOW, etc) or sites off Reddit. Use screenshots instead. Yes, there are edgelords posting awful things, we get it. But don't take matters into your own hands and brigade those corners of the internet. Instead, enjoy them here!

**6) Keep content relevant**

Try to make sure the posts are about self identified incels, not ""nice guys"", run of the mill sexists, or a dude kind of struggling with relationships. No videos. Avoid ""O woe is me"", ""rate me"", and ""lookism"" posts. There are already subreddits about dating advice, niceguys, neckbeards, creepyPMs and specific support subs for incels. Some discussion and advice wanted posts are allowed, but they're not the focus of this sub.

**7) Don't be a jerk**

The use of offensive insults like retard and autist are not permitted. Strive to be civil.

#Please check the [mega thread stickied to the very top of the front page of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowKids/comments/a7f41s/mega_thread_check_here_before_posting)) and sort by *top* and *new* to make certain that no one else has posted the thing you're about to post before posting.

**Don't Repost**

* *Meta posts may only be posted on Monday*

* *Check the front page [*hot*] before posting*

* *Check the first page of new [*new*] before posting*

**Don't Post Prohibited Posts**

* *Currently Prohibited (temporary ban)*

* *Permanently Prohibited (permanent ban)*

[There are ads that get spam posted here on a weekly basis that will get you temporarily banned.](https://imgur.com/a/gRcZA53)

And it's still a repost even though you took the screenshot yourself. It's not original content if you didn't make it yourself and if you didn't make it yourself there's a chance other people have also seen it, taken a photo/screenshot and posted it online. This effect is multiplied exponentially when it comes to mass-produced ads found on the internet. Just check the mega thread, top and new before posting.

If you do receive a temporary ban, don't complain to the mods. Whining about your suspension will earn you an added 5 day suspension. You will also receive a temporary 5-day ban if you argue with the moderators about removing your post.

* **Rule 1:** Respect the privacy of the people featured here. **Never link directly to Facebook.** Post a screenshot instead. Be sure to [**block out the following personal information on every post**](http://i.imgur.com/jDAp7QA.jpg):



    (a) Profile Pictures

    (b) Last names

    (c) Cities/Towns and other specific location info

    (d) Identifying features in photos posted to personal pages (Photos posted on public pages are okay.)


    Posts containing personal information will be removed. Repeated or severe violations may be grounds for a ban.

* **Rule 2:** **Be respectful;** this means no personal attacks. Personal attacks will result in a warning, which will then result in a ban.

* **Rule 3:** Comments attempting to point out that the post is fake or linking to /r/thathappened will be removed. This is a place to share funny social media posts, even if it does seem fake just try to see the humor in it. At the same time, please try to avoid posting things that are obviously fake. Feel free to put them in /r/oldpeoplecirclejerk.

* **Rule 4:**  Submissions must show that the subject doesn't fully understand proper use of social media. While this is broadly defined, it does not include posts that are strictly religious, political, or bigoted. Posts that do not meet this criteria will be removed. Subreddits linked below may be a more appropriate place for such content.

The world isn't binary, and sexual orientation doesn't have to be, either.  There is more than being straight or being gay. This group is for discussion and support for those who fall in between, for the ""shades of gray"" in what is often assumed to be one or the other:    

* bisexuals  
* pansexuals  
* omnisexuals  
* queers  
* non-straight individuals  

... or anyone who doesn't quite fit the otherwise binary ""straight"" and ""gay"" pattern. Whether sexual or asexual, everyone is welcome.

#SUBREDDIT BI-LAWS

We are not a strictly moderated subreddit but we ask that you are accepting of all people (particularly in your language) and treat everybody with respect. In particular, please keep the following rules in mind:

1. **Bigotry** (biphobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, etc.) is not allowed. Acting in such a manner will result in a temporary ban, followed by a permanent ban for following offenses.
2. **Erasing people's sexual orientations and/or gender identities** (e.g. denying the existence of bisexuality, asexuality, pansexuality, or non-binary gender) is not allowed.
3. **Spamming** is not allowed. This includes dating websites, hookup posts, and excessive self-promotion.
4. **Trolling** is not allowed. This may result in an immediate perma-ban.
5. **Selfie posts** outside the weekly Selfie Sunday threads are not allowed in order to keep content saturation to a minimum. Selfies can also be posted in /r/BiGoneMild. In addition, **no nude posts are allowed anywhere** on the sub. Those should be posted in /r/BiSexy (NSFW) or other subreddits appropriate for that type of content. Selfies include any picture of you, whether it was taken by you or someone else.
6. **Research Posts** must meet the following criteria:
 1. Surveys must be related to bisexuality or the LGBT community, **and**
 2. Surveys must be approved by an ethics board or similar body. Please post a link to the corresponding letter of approval.
 3. It is advised that both researchers and respondents give [this /r/lgbt post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/lstdy/a_note_regarding_the_socalled_researchers_that/) a quick read.
 4. All research **not** meeting this criteria must be submitted to the moderators for approval before being posted.

3pf09,t5_3pf09,bigtiddygothgf,"**BIG TIDDY GOTH GF**

**RULES**

1\. GIRLS POSTED MUST BE ***GOTH***  


- *GOTH* is defined as black or intensely colored hair, extremely pale skin (excepting different ethnicities- e.g. an African American goth would be exempted from this) and some kind of additional accessories that exemplify the goth lifestyle (clothing, piercings, tattoos, etc.) 

- **NO, WEARING BLACK LIPSTICK WITH YOUR TIDDIES OUT DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GOTH**

- **PLEASE DON'T MESSAGE THE MODS TRYING TO ARGUE A POST REMOVAL DUE TO A VIOLATION OF THIS RULE.  IF YOU HAVE TO ASK ""WHAT DOES GOTH EVEN MEAN?"", YOU DON'T NEED TO BE POSTING HERE.  TAKE IT TO /R/GONEWILD**


2\.  GIRLS POSTED MUST HAVE ***BIG TIDDIES***


- *BIG TIDDIES* are **not** defined by cup size, but rather by appearance and proportion.  

- that being said, don't be a Salty Boi.  Nobody here wants to see you whining in public.  Just report stuff and shut up. Which brings us to:


3\. DON'T BE A ***SALTY BOI***


- Don't be a big baby on this subreddit and whine at someone or about something.


4\.  BIG TIDDY GOTH GF MEMES ARE THE ROOTS OF THIS SUB.  MEMES WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME. 


- if you don't like a meme or think it's dumb or unfunny or off-topic, that's what the downvote button and comments are for.  feel free to pick apart shitty memes as long as you're not a Salty Boi about it. 


5\.  **DON'T TRY TO SELL SHIT**

- seriously.  it's scummy.  don't, in any way, solicit our subscribers to visit your pay site, or to buy your pics, or to buy your sweaty spiked dog collar. 

- **violation of Rule 5 results in getting banned**

- **if reporting a violation of Rule 5, provide proof.  we're not going to just take your word for it**

*2* Duplicate posts will be removed. | If you want to ask a question, please check the wiki, FAQ, the weekly question thread, or the reddit search bar before posting. If you want to post a discussion or comic/meme, please ensure that it hasn't been posted recently (1 month for discussion, 4 months for comics/memes). |  
*3* NSFW content must be tagged. | Any adult content that does not contain any real substance for discussion will be removed without warning. | 
*4* Stalking, harassment, and personal attacks will not be tolerated. | This rule we will take on a case by case basis. We consider intentionally baiting unproductive arguments as harassment. Other forms of harassment that we do not tolerate are personal attacks and stalking.
*5*  No direct links to Fire Emblem ROMs or ISOs. | Fan patches/hacks are acceptable so long as they aren't pre-patched onto the original ROM/ISO. It's acceptable to discuss emulation without linking to illegal material.
*6* Please use spoiler tags for major plot events, regardless of the game. | Not everyone has played every Fire Emblem game. It is only fair they get a chance to go into a story blind for the full experience. To use a spoiler tag in comments, by typing \[FE7](#s ""Beware the Black Fang!"") gives you: [FE7](#s ""Beware the Black Fang!""). 
*7* All posts must be tagged appropriately!| Use the flair option after creating a post to tag it as needed. Upon selecting the appropriate flair, identify the game.
*8* No spam. | Posts that serve no purpose or are exceedingly low effort are considered spam and will be removed. Repeatedly posting on the sub with a certain topic is also considered to be spam.
*9* Non-OC Fanart outside of the Fanart Hub. | No Fanart or Cosplay is to be posted unless it is of your own making, or you commissioned the artist and have permission to post. If you wish to post non-OC fanart please use our Fanart Hub linked at the top of the subreddit.
*10* No unapproved bots. | Many bots have a tendency to clog up comment sections and be generally annoying. If an unnecessary bot has posted in the sub, report it.
*11* Have fun! | There are many games and different playstyles, as such there is no true way to play. Enjoy the series to your liking!

**Spoiler tag:**   
\[FE7](#s ""Beware the Black Fang!"")

[FE7](#s ""Beware the Black Fang!"")

The above spoiler tag only works in self-posts and comments, not post titles.

Mods will respond appropriately to violations of the rules to the degree at which they are broken. Warnings will be given out and suspensions/bans will follow if the behavior is repeated.

**Flairing posts on mobile:**

Please use comment commands if you are on mobile to flair your posts, the comment commands are given [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/wiki/meta/flaircommands).

##Rules

 We're all understanding here, but please try to use common sense and help us out by following these rules.

Rule 1: 

* Keep it civil and follow the Reddiquette. No flaming, trolling, racism, sexism, bigotry or hate-speech.

* No NSFW content is allowed on this sub.

* Mainshaming is not permitted. Shaming a user on the sub just because of a hero they use is toxic behaviour and it will be treated as such.


Rule 2: Witch-Hunting

* There will be no tolerance of Witch-Hunting. Any posts attempting to incite a witch-hunt will immediately lead to a permanent ban.
 
Rule 3: Self-Promotion

* Please follow the Guidelines to [Self-Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) aka 10% Rule.

* Those not following the 10% rule for example: Posting any linking to your ""own"" content (Website, videos, twitch, etc.), without contributing to the subreddit; with at least 10 constructive posts will be removed and a warning issued

Rule 4: Low-effort/Low-Quality Memes

* Low-effort/low-quality memes are not allowed. Poorly cropped images with a white text bar, single emoji titles, poor readability on text, putting For Honor text on an unrelated image are for example breaking this rule. Template memes are also not allowed. Memes which discourage discussion and violate this rule are encouraged to be shared on /r/ForHonorMemes. More details can be [found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/wiki/)


Rule 5: Low-effort/Low-quality Posts, Reposts

* No Scoreboard Posts, Loading/Face-off Screen Posts or Chat logs. 

* Sob stories, Rants and/or posts not directly related to For Honor are subject to removal at the moderators' discretion. Posts should be a space for meaningful discussion.

* Do not re-post threads. Check the New Posts page and use the search function before posting.

Rule 6: PTS Feedback

* Do not post Public Test Server feedback here, instead direct those posts to /r/ForHonorPTS.
 
Rule 7: 3rd party resellers

* Do not link 3rd party game re-sellers that are not on the [Ubisoft approved list](https://support.ubi.com/en-us/Faqs/000022581/Approved-Retail-Vendor-List).

Rule 8: LFG Threads
 
* Do not post Looking For Group threads. You can do so the [For Honor Discord Server](http://discord.gg/forhonor)

Rule 9: Political subjects & Reporting Players

* No Political related posts are allowed. This also applies to posts with emblems that reference a political party. If you have a clip with someone with the symbol, that's fine as that is not your fault, however if you are the one with the emblem your post WILL be removed and also your uplay account may be reported to the Devs.

* Do not use the subreddit to report players in game breaking the Code of Conduct. Use the in-game reporting tool and/or report players via the Ubisoft Support website. 
 

We encourage users to use a descriptive title for your post, and choose a proper [""Flair""](https://i.gyazo.com/e1c5f7e1debdd523166107bb5bcfc105.png). Posts won't be removed if this is not done, It's just encouraged.

2ssp7,t5_2ssp7,TooAfraidToAsk,"Welcome to TooAfraidToAsk, a sub that's dedicated to providing a more open question&answer discussion experience. We allow throwaways and do not remove 'google-able' questions. While your question may have been answered elsewhere, maybe its answer wasn't sufficient, maybe you didn't understand the answer or maybe you are looking for a discussion about the answer. At any rate, your question is welcome here as long as it follows our only three rules:

**Rule 1. No posts asking how to harm yourself or others**

*we mean only topics asking for an answer that will aid someone in committing suicide or harming others.  These questions are not allowed. Answering a question with a real answer on how to accomplish self-harm or harm of others OR telling the OP to do it will result in a permanent ban. This is a zero tolerance policy.*

**Rule 2. Hate speech is explicitly not allowed.** 

*discussion of hate speech is okay, users are free to discuss why a word may be offensive or why certain words are considered offensive for example. Users are not allowed to direct hate speech to another user or group. The mod team observes no special distinction between racial terms or severity. We have a zero tolerance policy. You will be permanently banned without warning.*

**Rule 3: No soap boxing, asking for karma or spamming.**

*we will try our best to limit the amount of trolling, but to remain in line with our vision of a community driven sub, we would strongly prefer to keep 10 trolls rather than remove a single real inquiry. These infractions result in a 3 day ban with warning, repeated infractions will result in a permanent ban*


All opinions are welcome as long as they are presented respectfully and follow the above guidelines. Rules here are kept more relaxed than our sister subs intentionally to allow as close to an organic user experience as possible. Automod uses reports to decide if a submission is removed and these are all reviewed by a mod within 24 hours. Bans are typically last resorts and the mod team maintains a strict open-door policy. Do not hesitate to reach out to us about any questions, concerns and/or comments you have about the sub.

##Sirocco the Kākāpō 

Besides being our God Emperor, Sirocco is ""the champion bird for the New Zealand Kākāpō Recovery programme.""

The kakapo (Māori: kākāpō or ""night parrot""), is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot endemic to New Zealand.

As of 2016, there are only 154 living Kākāpō in the world, all of which have names, and all living on three closely monitored, predator free islands around New Zealand.

#Rules
**Please report any rule breakers.**

1. **No Spoilers**

    No spoilers in titles and spoiler tag comments when talking about episodes which aired after the one the post is discussing. Spoiler tags can be implemented as:

    The >! and !< have to be touching the words, not separated by a space.

    Like this:

    \>!spoiler here!<

   **NOT** like this:

    \>! spoiler here !<

   Otherwise it will not work

    When posting screenshots and images that contain spoilers from recent episodes, mark the post as NSFW to hide the thumbnail.

    To be 100% safe it would be wise to stay off the sub until you are caught up or to only participate in the official episode discussion threads.

2. **No piracy**

    Links to or requests for streams, torrents, etc. will be removed.

3. **Be civil**

   No overly foul language directed at one another or the cast/crew of the show. No targeted harassment of fellow users. Please do not downvote others for having a differing opinion than you.

4. **No reposts**

   If content has been posted recently we will remove duplicates at our discretion. If you are reposting someone’s original content be sure to give credit to the OP.

5. **No self promotion**

   If you feel that the content you have created is high quality and original, message the mods for prior permission.

6. **Post your favorite episode rankings only in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7ms2r8/black_mirror_episode_rankings_thread/).**

7. **Post episode connections/easter eggs in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7mn76z/master_list_of_episode_connections_easter_eggs/).**

8. **Keep minor episode discussions contained to the individual discussion threads.**

    You can find the Season 4 discussion threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7mrr1o/black_mirror_s4_general_discussionepisode/). Please try asking your questions there first.

   Low effort posts more suited for the episode discussions may be removed. Exceptions may be made.

[](/r/Fallout/wiki/rules)


1. All posts must be from, directly reference or talk about something to do with Fallout 76.

2. Do not post spoilers in titles, period. Use spoiler tags when commenting sensitive information.

3. No meme content as posts is allowed. This is not limited to image macros, it also applies to popular trends of any kind. Comments are fine.

4. Follow proper [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) when submitting and commenting. Keep it civil, do not make personal attacks to other users, even if they initiated it. Absolutely no harassment, witchhunting, sexism, racism or hate speech will be tolerated.

5. Do not spam. Always follow [Reddit guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for self-promotion when sharing your own content. More than 1/10 of your posts or comments being self-promotional is spamming. Livestream promotion is not allowed.

6. Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.

7. Do not post rumors or leaks without actual evidence. Second-hand information or word of mouth does not constitute as evidence. If you have evidence, you are welcome to [submit it](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76), in confidence, to the unaffiliated moderators for verification. Only upon moderator verification can you post it.

8. No promotion or enabling of pirated content. This includes but is not limited to: torrents, free full-game downloads, .exe files, pirated mods, pirated keys or any third party market resellers.

9. No Witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). Do not name in shame in general.

10. No suggestion posts may be made if they contain topics which have been retired to [Bethesda Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)

All posts and comments in end, come down to moderator discretion.

> ##About
> This subreddit is dedicated to showcasing interesting and entertaining chemical reactions. [Read our Wiki for more information on the types of posts you will see here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/wiki/index). Due to our subreddit's size and variety of interesting gifs, over time this we have grown to be accommodating to other types of chemistry, physics and biology related gifs (those who would just like to view one type may use our filters on this sidebar).

---

> ##Rules
>1. **Physical reactions are allowed**, along with an extension of other gifs that we feel relevant to this subreddit which you can read about in our wiki [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/wiki/index) under the ""Post Categories"" section. **Posts will be tagged accordingly based on what category they fall under.**
>
>2. **Not every post that is not a chemical reaction is a physical reaction** or relevant to this subreddit's accepted posts. For example a post featuring a can being smashed or the motion of a pendulum will be removed.
>
>3. **All link posts must be in either gif or html5 format.** Any link post that is not in one of these formats will be deleted. Any interesting or relevant images or videos (whether they be about the subreddit or a demonstration) must be done in a self post.
>
>4. **No albums of gifs allowed in link post or self post form.** This is due to trouble categorizing a post which often has multiple gifs that don't fall under one category and leads to a misleading post and confusion.
>
>5. **Reposts are allowed and will be tagged as such for filtering sake.** They will not be removed unless a moderator deems the repost to be of a demonstration or particular gif that has been posted too often (e.g. Mercury(II) Thiocyanate Decomposition).
>
>6. **All link posts must have the source of the gif/html5 video posted in the comments.** We expect the original poster to do this, however if someone else does so then it will not be removed. Reposts of a post with a source that do not contain the source in the comments will be deleted.
>
>7. **Link posts utilizing the gif/html5 format to skirt the rules will be removed.** For example if a demonstration is posted that is a gif but is essentially static image then it will be removed. We will approach this rule on a case-by-case basis to avoid removing naturally slow/lengthy demonstrations to the best of our ability. 
>
>*In rare cases, exceptions may be made by the moderators if a post is exceptionally intriguing and relevant to discussion in order to maintain quality standards.*

##**10. Do not repost questions answered in the FAQ or sidebar**
>- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/faq) to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)
>- [Click here for recently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/search?q=flair%3Ahelp&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

##**11. Don't be a dick**
> * Do not feed the trolls. If you suspect trolling, report and ignore.
> * Trolling, baiting, or (obviously) provocative comments may be removed at moderator discretion.
> * Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**12. Flair your posts if required**
>- Fanart, Cosplay, and Merchandise should be flaired appropriately.

* Properly  [link flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/flair) your posts.


2 [**Limit the Verbal Abuse.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_2._no_verbal_abuse_of_any_sort.)

 * Keep it civil. Its not hard. 

3 [**No posts related to other subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_3._no_posts_related_to_other_subreddits.2C_forums.2C_or_websites.)

* Simple enough, right? This is not /r/drama

4 [**No low quality posts.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_4._no_low_quality_posts.)

 * E.g. Memes / Jokes / comics or unrelated content etc.

5 [**No reposts.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_5._no_reposts.)

* Please try to limit your reposts. We don't need 50 stories about the same event. It will lead to other current stories being buried. 

#Know Your Rights

* [What To Do If You're Stopped By Police](http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform-immigrants-rights-racial-justice/know-your-rights-what-do-if-you)

* [Take Jury Duty! Understand Jury Nullification. Stanhope Explains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-5rvtSpak)

* It is 100% legal to openly record police in all 50 states as long as you do not physically interfere with the officer. (It's also probably wise to speak as little as possible, but DO make note of details - location, names, etc) 

* Police officers do not have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" while preforming their public duties.

* If an officer says it's illegal to record him, that officer is lying to try and trick you into shutting off the camera so you won't have proof of them violating your rights.

* Use a livestreaming app to record your videos. If your phone is seized, the police cannot delete the video because the video was never on the phone to begin with.

>###Spoilers
>
- **Spoilers are NEVER allowed in the title of a post.** When in doubt, play it safe!
- **Spoilers are defined as:** 
1. (1) ONE's original web comic which Murata's version (the redraw) has not yet covered. 
2. (2) Screenshots of Murata's [live streams](https://twitcasting.tv/nebu_kuro).
3. (3) The Japanese raw, before the English translation has come out.
4. (4) The current manga chapter, up to 24 hours after the English translation has come out.
- **Tag posts as spoilers** by putting the word spoilers anywhere in the title (a bot will auto-mark the post) or by clicking the ""spoiler"" button on your submission.
- **Titles must indicate which type of spoiler** it is (web comic/live stream/raw/manga spoilers). If not indicated, it is assumed to be web comic spoilers (as in the original web comic by ONE).
- **Comments** that are spoilers but are not made in spoiler marked threads must be put in spoiler tags as follows: 
>
\[spoilers](/s ""spoiler text here"")
>
Which shows up as:
>
[spoilers](/s ""spoiler text here"")
>
>or \>!spoiler text here!<
>
>!spoiler text here!<
>
> Which is Reddit's now official syntax for clickable spoiler text.

>Indicate what kind of spoiler it is by replacing 'Spoiler' above with 'webcomic/livestream/raw spoilers' or whatever description makes it clear. 

>Web comic and live stream spoilers are independent of one another (ie live stream spoilers should be hidden in ONE web comic threads, vice versa...)

A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)

> ### All titles must start with TIFU
> - **TIFU** stands for today I fucked up, which means something you did that is your fault. Just because something bad happened to you doesn't mean it's a fuck up.
> -  **TIFU** must be at the beginning of the post title or it will automatically be removed. 
> - **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story. 

######[](#space)

> ### Uninspired, lacking in context, literal shitpost, overly vulgar and glorifying illegal activities posts may be removed at mods discretion
> - **Uninspired** as in something that is super common, lacking in imagination or originality.
> - **Context** as in the story doesn't have any more info beyond the title. *note*: All posts must contain at least 750 characters of meaningful content.
> - **Shitpost** as in literally involving defecation or other bodily fluids.
> - **Overly vulgar** includes obscene situations, such as, but not limited to, incest, minors, death and assault to humans and animals. Consensual situations between two, unrelated adults should be fine. Vulgar does not mean using bad words. 
> - **Illegal activities** that you glorify or giving advice on how to do something illegal.
> - **Not Your Fault** as in it was just something bad that happened to you; if it wasn't directly your fault, it wasn't your fuckup.

######[](#space)

> ### All posts must end with a TL;DR and tag NSFW when necessary 
> - **TL;DR** or too long didn't read which is a summarization of your post in a few bitesize sentence. At minimum, your TL;DR summary must contain your fuckup and its consequences. You may include additional information if you'd like. The TL;DR must be at the very end of your post.
> - **NSFW** or not safe for work. If you're not sure if it's NSFW or not, better to be safe than sorry. 

######[](#space)

> ### Be civil and don't be disruptive
> - **Be civil** means don't do these things; personal attacks, harassment,  trolling, and bigotry. Use your better judgement. 
> - **Disruptive** such as posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information (real/fake). This includes yourself or others, and refers, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, or any social media accounts. As well as brigading with either votes or comments.

######[](#space)

> ### No spam, bots or advertising
> - **Spam**, don't link to things that you may or may not be rewarded for. Posting links of you narrating a story is considered spam.
> - **Bots** are annoying and will be banned.
> - **Advertising**, we are not a platform for you (patreon or charities) or your products, seek https://www.redditinc.com/advertising instead.

###Some guidelines

#####Commenting
* Everyone has their own definition of frugality, and reasons for being frugal.

* Discuss and debate, but don't fight over it, or put down anyone who do not share your particular view on frugality.  

* Do not respond to belligerence with belligerence, and don't be baited into violating the rules. Report infractions and let the moderators handle it. 

* Observe [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

#####Posting

* Be informative. If requesting advice, explain your situation as best you can so that users have something to work with. 

* If posting an image, make sure the title is informative and clear in how it relates to frugality, and ideally accompany it with a comment relevant to it.

* If posting something you made, explain how or why you went about it, how much it cost, how much time it took, and share the recipe or materials needed. 

* Removed posts will include flair indicating why it was removed. If you have questions about a removal, [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFrugal).

This subreddit is intended for pictures of good-looking, photogenic cats in poses that make them look like supermodels. If you look at a picture of a cat and think *damn, that's one good looking cat for sure!* it probably belongs here.

If your kitty has an Instagram account or some other social media account, you're welcome to share it in a comment under your post and in your user flair.

**WARNING: Please DO NOT post another user's photo without their permission and/or with a title suggesting that the cat is yours! That's not okay.**

***
**Rules, suggestions, advice:**

1. Submissions must be photos of cats.
2. The cats in pictures must have this look (pose, expression, lighting) that makes them look like supermodels.
3. All cats are beautiful, but not all photos make them look like supermodels. If you're not sure if your picture fits here, think: if there was a Cat Vogue magazine, can you imagine your picture being in it?
4. Pictures of famous cats are okay, but please mention (in the title and/or comment) that it's not your cat. Please try to refrain from posting photos from actual professional photoshoots.
5. If you're posting a picture of your cat, it would be great if you mentioned his/her name somewhere. We'll be able to attach a name to that pretty face :)
6. Multiple pictures of your cat are welcome, but try not to flood the subreddit with them. Try to wait some time before submitting another pic and if you really want to add several at once, please make one post with an album.",78830,False

##**Guidelines**

1\. **Submissions must directly relate to MHW**

> Topics that are not related to Monster Hunter: World will be removed. This includes posts that are low effort and attempts at “Karma Farming” (See rule 5). Meme posting is totally acceptable, but it must be evident some sort of effort went into making it. We fully encourage high quality (Dank) memes, as it can sometimes be the best content on the sub. Low quality memes are pretty obvious attempts at Karma Farming, and are subject to removal at moderator discretion.

2\. **Posts and Comments Must Be in English**

> We understand that /r/MonsterHunterWorld has a worldwide fan base, but all posts and comments must be communicated via the English language.

3\. **Use the Search Bar First: DO NOT REPOST**

> Do not repost content that already exists on /r/MonsterHunterWorld. This also includes posting topics that have been discussed in the past. Please take the time to use the search bar if you have a question. It's likely it may have been asked before. Doing so drastically reduces clutter on the subreddit's feed. Submissions that violate this rule will be removed. Multiple violations will result in a temporary/permanent ban (depending on severity).

4\. **Be Respectful. “Toxicity” Will NOT Be Tolerated!**   

> While we have no problem with disagreements/discussions, the following behavior will NOT be tolerated: Insults, inciting pointless arguments, trolling, hate speech, discrimination, witch hunts against other members, etc. Posts that contain identifying information, including guesses at other party’s online/real ID’s, will also be removed and reported to reddit admins. Uncivil/toxic behavior of any kind will be removed at moderator discretion. Repeated offenses WILL result in a ban.

5\. **Low Effort/Karma Farming Posts Are NOT Allowed**  

> Content or information that does not contribute to a meaningful discussion, or attempts at “Karma Farming” will be removed at moderator discretion. This includes, but is not limited to: Carves & Quest Results, Kill Screens, Decorations, Minor Achievements (trophies), Crafted Equipment collections, Investigations, pictures of TV/Monitor Screens,…etc. This content belongs on r/Memehunter or r/MHKillscreen. Multiple offenses of this rule may result in a temporary/permanent ban.

6\. **Self-Advertising, Monetized Content, or Clickbait**

> No spam or clickbait content is allowed. These will be removed immediately. Self-Promotion that is thoughtful and well received, may be posted at a ratio of 9:1. Other self-promotion will be removed at the discretion of the moderators. Twitch streams are not allowed under any circumstances without the express permission of the moderation team. Asking for money, donations, “social media follows” are not allowed. Failure to comply with this rule may result in a ban.

7\. **Posts Related to Cheating/Hacking/Game Mods**

> We have a zero-tolerance policy on posts that share/encourage hacks or cheating. These posts will be removed and you will be permanently banned. THE ONLY POSTS ALLOWED IN THIS CATEGORY ARE TRANSMOG AND QOL CONTENT! This will be enforced strictly. Prohibited posts & COMMENTS include: no links to ANY sites related to modding, damage mods, decoration drop rate alterations, or ANY OTHER GAME ALTERATION THAT MIGHT RESULT IN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. There are many subreddits dedicated to such topics.

8\. **Spoilers**

3n7fs,t5_3n7fs,perfectlycutscreams,"Rules:

--REMEMBER TO REPORT VIDEOS THAT BREAK THE RULES!--

-Post videos of perfectly cut screams (Screams do not need to be cut off by the ending of the video((No timestamp abusing however))).

-If a youtube link is available, please use that instead of v.reddit. We like to support content creators here, and v.reddit takes away credit and views to the creators who need it.

-Don't be racist or some shit ^(if somebody is being racist, snitch on them super hard)

-Don't spoil stuff either. Nobody likes spoilers. If your content contains spoilers for something, please mark them as such. 

--You can mark a spoiler by using the code >!!< ex. \>!spoiler text goes here!< | Should look like.. >!Gandalf kills Dumbledore in the Millennium Falcon with a candle stick!<

-Also try to keep videos short. There isn't a limit, this isn't YTHaiku or anything, but the shorter the better.

-No reposting. Let's just put 3 months as a statute of limitations for reposting. If a video is 3 months old, it's fair game. Okay? We good?

-Absolutely no NSFL or animal cruelty. This is a friendly place, even if the video is funny a lot of people don't want to see that.",133107,False

**I might be 🤔🤔🤔 a massive whore 😩😩😩 but if y'all reposting images 😠😠😠 I'll show you the door 👉🔑🔑🔑**|**No reposts of recent content.** Please don't post anything that's been posted in the last few days or weeks, or are one of the all-time top posts. Due to the nature of /r/comedyhomicide, the sub often gets linked to in the comments of other popular posts, so we sometimes get an influx of the same post several times a day. When you go to post, please check the most recent posts and the top posts of all time to ensure that you're post isn't a repost.
**You best 🤩🤩🤩 be blocking out names 🤬🤬🤬 or  else you'll be dealing 🤟🤟🤟 with my GAINS 💪💪💪** | **No personal info.** If your post contains any identifiable information, names, or usernames, it will be removed. Please make sure that all personal info is blocked or blurred out. However, if the person is a well-known public figure, it's fine.
**If you go and harass 👊👊👊 or start a witch hunt 🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️ your days are numbered 💯💯💯💯 coz you'll get a punt 😡😡😡** | **No targeted harassment or witchhunting.** Do not link to a person's profile or encourage witch hunting against someone, or otherwise target / bully any person. This includes encouraging vote brigading to other subreddits.
**You can be homer secksual 💁‍♀️💁‍♀️💁‍♀️ or you can be lebanese 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈, but if you gonna hate on those groups 🚫🚫🚫 get outta here with your toxicities 😤😤😤** | **No hate speech.** Insults aimed at any group will not be tolerated. Any racist, sexist, etc. comments are worthy of a ban.
**If it's a spoiler 🚗🚗🚗 of if it's some nudes 🤪🤪🤪 you best tag that shit 😤😤😤 for the rest of us dudes 👍👍👍** | **Use spoiler / NSFW tags.** If your post contains a spoiler or is NSFW, please tag it correctly.
**Be nice 😻😻😻** | **Follow reddit's site-wide rules.** Obviously. If you see any post that breaks these rules, please report it.

2svqn,t5_2svqn,Nicegirls,"###### [](#h6)
>For all the self proclaimed ""[nice girls](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Girl)."" For the women who complain ""guys are only interested in sluts."" For women who complain that men are shallow for not dating overweight women, while also demanding that their man have washboard abs. For the women who hold others to the highest possible standard, but have no standards for themselves. 

###### [](#h6)
>This is primarily a subreddit for images of these ""nice girls"" demonstrating their unique charm. Videos, articles, and other content are welcome.

###### [](#h6)
>This sub is not for female incels. This place is not for crazy girls. If you swap the genders and it doesn't belong on r/niceguys, then don't post it. THIS IS NOT A 'MEN ARE TRASH' SUB.

###### [](#h6)
>This subreddit is not a women hating subreddit, please refrain from making sexist comments or being a bigot. It will NOT be tolerated. Keep that bullshit out of here. 

##Rules

- **Rule 1**: Post NiceGirls only. If you're unsure if your post shows a nicegirl, look at the definition above.

Things that aren't a nicegirl:

+ a crazygirl
+ hypothetical nicegirl. This includes memes
+ a niceguy
+ women with not enough context to prove ""nice""
+ 'Men are trash' posts

If your post is long, **highlight relevant parts**. No one wants to read 1000 words to find the nicegirl.

**Rule 2**: NO IDENTIFYING INFO OF ANY KIND. This includes personal info, username, first name, last name, profile pic, faces, twitter handle, instagram name and any other username. No public pages or usernames. No watermarks. Censor your own name. There are no exceptions at all. This includes videos. Any infraction of this rule will result in a ban. If we can read the name **AT ALL**, you will be banned.

**Rule 3**: Any form of sexism, insensitivity, racism, or intolerance will not be allowed. This includes posts and comments. You will be permabanned.

**Rule 4**: No low-effort titles. Your title must be descriptive. Anything referencing where you found the post will be removed.

**Rule 5**: No NSFW/NSFL content.

**Rule 6**: No reposts.

5. NSFW posts must be tagged. 
6. No NSFL posts.

#Sub-Reddit Rules and Regulations  

1) 18+ years of age for posters and viewers. **NO PICTURES OF MINORS**.

2) **NO NEGATIVE AND/OR OFFENSIVE COMMENTS OR PM's**. Offenders will be banned. Please report them if you see them.

3) **NO POSTING OR HINTING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**. If you think you recognize someone please keep it to yourself. Flagrant violations will result in being banned.

4) **WE REQUIRE VERIFICATION**. This sub is for original content only. All users posting must be verified. Please go to r/getverified for more details. Don't post content that is not yours or you may potentially be banned.

5) **SHARE YOUR REAL STORIES**. Got a great story get **stickied**. Would love to hear about your experiences. Not a world renowned writer, no problem, all your stories need to be are real and hot to get top placement.

6) **SUBMISSIONS NOT SHOWING UP?** New accounts will sometimes get flagged by the spam filter. Unfortunately this will sometimes send perfectly good submissions to the moderation que and the submission will not show up to the general audience until it has been manually approved. **If you do not see your submission, don't worry, a moderator will approve your submission in a timely manner.**

7) **KIK SPAMMING**. Please don't do it. If every post you make has requests to contact you on your Kik in either the link title or images themselves it defeats the purpose of this sub. It's about sharing.  This also includes other social media platforms as well (Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, etcetera).

8) **VOTE MANIPULATION**. Vote manipulation is not only against Reddit rules, whether it is manual, programmatic, or otherwise but is also unfair to all the other submitters. All posts that attempt to manipulate, whether upvoting or downvoting, will be removed without warning. 

9) **MULTIPLE POSTS.** Please don't flood the new queue. If you have multiple photos (same set) to submit please post them in an album.

10) **QUALITY COUNTS.** Please post the best possible image possible in terms of content and image resolution.  Please, we ask no screen-caps because they are almost invariable poor in quality. We may remove submissions based on our discretion that don't meet minimum quality guidelines.

11) **VIDEO SUBMISSIONS.** Video submissions are always appreciated. Please consider cross posting your video submissions to r/homesex and/or r/happycuckold as well.

#Community Rules
In addition to [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy), please familiarise yourself with the following:

1. You need to be the very best, like no one ever was. Treat everyone with respect and engage in good faith.
* All content must be either Nintendo news from the original source or opinion about Nintendo games, systems and products.
* Discussion should be open-ended and seek different opinions. Content with neither context to inform nor prompts for discussion are not substantial enough for a post.
* Posts should have clear, descriptive titles that properly convey what the content is.
* Don't be shady. No buying, selling, trading, or begging. No affiliate/referral links. No enabling piracy or sharing illegal content.
* All giveaways and contests must either be held by Nintendo or approved in advance by messaging the moderators.
* For your own safety always wear a wrist strap when browsing Reddit.

Our moderation policy is not to keep track of every rule infraction, and everything is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, we do ban users who make personal attacks or buy/sell/beg.  We will try to tell you how you can resubmit, or recommend a more a suitable subreddit. However, please read other subreddits' rules before submitting there.

Please be considerate when discussing plot details for games new or old. Don't put spoilers in post titles at all. Putting text into this format will hide spoilers: [Nintendo]\(/spoiler) becomes [Nintendo](/spoiler).

3jj03,t5_3jj03,iamatotalpieceofshit,"A place to post social media screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

##**Rules:**

1. Take a screenshot and completely **redact all information that can be used to identify a person**. This includes, but is not limited to: first and last names, usernames (including your own, including the symbol which identifies a commenter as you, including any other people featured in the image, including public accounts), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, and other information like addresses, phone numbers, and license plates.  If you intentionally post personal information, you will be banned. This is to prevent brigading and harassment, so we take this rule very seriously.  
**Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, openly solicit personal information, or contact the people featured here. Don't even wax poetic about wanting to post identifying information. You will be banned.**

2. **Do not encourage, glorifiy, or incite violence.**  
For example: ""Kill yourself"", ""It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles"", ""This guy needs to die"", ""I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver"", etc.

3. **Must be a total piece of shit**  
A total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, annoying but harmless things, memes & image macros, trophy hunters, people who put down their pets humanely, short & unoriginal comments, overly political/partisan posts, screenshots of someone's Reddit profile, petty arguments, fights/simple revenge, and common/unoriginal crimes do not belong here. Anti-vaxxer posts rarely belong here.  If your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed.  
**If you post a picture with the backstory in the title, no story in the image, or the face of a public figure with no story, you will be banned.  This isn't punchablefaces.**

4. **Avoid reposting**.  If you see a repost, report it, preferably with a link to the previous post.  

5. **No news articles. Images, screenshots, text-posts, & gifs only.** Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred.  Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it.  **Screenshots of the headline only will be removed.**  This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.  

---
**Do not report users through modmail**, use the report button with a custom reason.  The only exception is for reporting people who are actually doxxing or other immediate threats.  Do not report people for being mean to you, arguing, or making comments which you disagree with.  If you abuse the report button or modmail, you will be banned.  **If you ask for someone who follows the rules to be banned, you may be banned.**

Posts with bad titles will be automatically removed, you can then resubmit with a better title.  No, you cannot edit your post title or image once it's been created, and neither can the mods.

2xdht,t5_2xdht,Undertale,"-
Welcome! We're an unofficial community of fans and a place to share *Undertale* fanwork.

[**UNDERTALE**](http://undertale.com/) is a video game about a child who falls into an underworld filled with monsters. FIGHT or ACT your way through battles while dodging magic bullet attacks. Every monster has unique attacks and personality—and they’re all in your way. You can show them MERCY if you want. You might even make friends. But what will you do if you meet a relentless killer?

*Undertale* is available in English and Japanese for Windows, Mac, Linux, PS4, Vita, and Switch.

*Undertale* is created by Toby Fox, who is a dog.

Toby's next project is **[DELTARUNE](https://www.deltarune.com)**, a legend whispered among shadows. *Deltarune Chapter 1* is a free download for Windows and Mac.

*Deltarune* fanwork and discussion are welcome.

## Blue stop signs

We have once again retired the spoiler rule. You may post openly about all parts of the game.

**Here are the rules still in force:**

1. Keep your posts relevant to the Undertale and Deltarune fandoms.

2. Don't share or discuss content that is more sexually suggestive or obscene than the game itself.

3. Don't promote the kinds of merchandise that Toby is not okay with. [Details here.](http://undertale.tumblr.com/post/139726155020/changing-policy-on-fan-merch)

4. No soliciting, please.
 * Do not ask users to participate in anything that is not Undertale-based.
 * Do not pit us against outsiders.
 * Do not post about upvotes.

5. When submitting fan work, name the artist in your post title or in a comment.

6. Be kind and keep your posts free of slurs.

7. We enforce the [Reddit user agreement](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). We ask that you keep [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) in mind at all times.

**Hit that report button** to draw our attention to anything that breaks a rule or shares your art against your wishes. **Your reports really help.**

[You can modmail us with any concerns.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FUndertale)

Our spam filter removes posts and comments for many reasons. Filtered domains include Discord, Dropbox, and link shorteners. Be aware that your post or comment may be invisible to other users until a moderator reviews and approves it.

[](#bigspecialbutton)[List of All Known Upcoming Town Halls](https://townhallproject.com/)



The subreddit to distill useful information and have discussion on how to best resist the Trump administration and those who enable it. Note well: this is not intended to be just another Anti-Trump circle-jerk. While this rule isn't absolute, please try to focus your energy on productive action. Also, feel free to add and suggest content.

#How is this different from EnoughTrumpSpam?

This subreddit is for organizing and discussing resistance against Trump and his government, which thrives on dividing USA by skin tone and religion. We believe this is wrong and action must be taken.

This is not necessarily a liberal or left-wing subreddit. Center(-right) and other anti-Trump people are welcome as well, as long as you agree with the common cause: To stop America from heading in the wrong direction of xenophobia and racism.

#Rules

1) No Trolls

2) No Badfaithers 

3) No Threats of Violence

4) No Garbage Sources

5) No Re-litigating the Primary

6) No Language Using Deprecating Words of Bigotry

7) No references to subreddits and users of those subreddits who may disagree with us

8) No memes or low effort posts

9) No use of ""BREAKING"" or ALL CAPS in titles.

10) If you're still a full-throated Trump supporter at this point, you probably don't belong here.

We will also remove reposts and common submission/questions from the last 3 months  and wherever possible consolidate discussion to a central thread to facilitate organization on the subreddit.

Do not post rude comments directed towards other community members or the moderators. 

Contribute constructively to discussions, and try to flag posts and comments that break our subreddit rules.

####2) Relevance

All posts must be directly related to Arrested Development. No ""Actors acting"" or vague tie-ins to the show from unrelated posts elsewhere on Reddit or the web. This may include some political content if things become too toxic.

Things that are frequently posted and/or vague tie-ins and low effort content will be automatically removed. 

They include (but are not limited to):

- license plates

- captchas

- coincidental instances of the words bees or beads that do not reference the show

- posts that do not stand (or seem to relate to the show) without the title

- screenshots of comments

- Loblaws grocery store, Steve Holt the magician, other coincidental names that are obviously not referencing this show

- speculation (i.e. looks like Tobias was here)

- lookalikes

####3) Piracy

Don't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.

####4) Vote Manipulation

Asking for upvotes (such as ""For every upvote..."" or ""If this gets x upvotes...."") is forbidden. Bots and astroturfing are forbidden and will be reported to the Reddit admins.

####5) Image hosting

Images, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.

####6) Self-Promotion

The promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.

**Hey chefs, check out our totally awesome rules and features right ⬇ below ⬇**
----
* Rules

* Copy and paste content instead of just linking to it. Please do not make the entirety of your copypasta your title with only a link to the source in the self post. Your title should be a quote from the pasta or the overall idea of what it represents. The body of the self post should contain the pasta.

* Emoji copypastas are 💯% OK 👍👍👍👌👌👌

* Sentences with clap emojis inserted in between are low effort and will be removed.

* Check if someone already posted it. Use the search feature and enter a couple of keywords to see if anything comes up.

* Copypasta should be accessible and easy to copy and paste without extra hassle. Always copy a comment with formatting intact (This includes new lines and paragraph breaks). Use [""source"" on RES](http://i.imgur.com/yOMlQYJ.png) to avoid stuff like linked ""[1]"" and ""[2]""

* Do not add quotation blocks in your copypasta. [Example.](http://i.imgur.com/uJhPTcL.png).

* Please label original content as [OC] or the commenters will spam about the source.

* Copypasta which takes advantage of /u/CummyBot2000 in any way, shape or form is strictly prohibited and violators will be banned. This includes ninja-editing to make it look like cummy is saying something different than the OP post.

* Posts that contain ""For every upvote I will ____"" and other upvote begging posts will be removed as they are not copypasta and the posters will be banned

**Posting Rules:**

* **Read the [Posting Guidelines & Author FAQ,](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/posting_guidelines) and make sure your story fits all of the guidelines before posting. If you are unsure whether or not your story meets the guidelines, feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnosleep) with a draft (preferably in a google doc) before posting.**

 The [Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/posting_guidelines) include more details on some rules, as well as rules not listed in the sidebar.

 All stories, including each part of a series, must follow these guidelines or they will be removed.

***

* **Only post your original stories.**

***

* **Your submission must be a story.** 

 If you have a non-story meta post to make, please visit the discussion subreddit at /r/NoSleepOOC. When in doubt, see the fine folks over at /r/nosleepworkshops for advice.

***

* **All stories must be horror.**

***

* **The inclusion of horrible events does not necessarily make a story horror.** For this reason, certain topics, while they may be scary, are not allowed as the focal point of the story. These certain topics include, but are not limited to: rape, pedophilia, necrophilia, child abuse, torture porn, gorenography, and mental illness/health disorders. These topics can be included in the story, but cannot be central to the plot. [Click here for more information on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/horriblenothorror)

***

* **Stories must be believable within reason.** [Click here for more information on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/believability)

***

* **Stories must be a minimum of 500 words.** Please plan your story accordingly or consider posting at /r/shortscarystories.

***

* **Updates to series posts must be at least 1000 words.** 

***

* **Do not comment out of character in your post. Remember: everything is true here, even if it’s not.** 

***

* **No Solicitation.** A small, discreet link to your personal website, YouTube channel, or author page is acceptable at the end of a story as long as it is not a fundraising site, sales site,  book promotion or mailing list.

***

* **Graphic content should be marked with Trigger Warning/NSFW tags and any appropriate flair.**

***

* **Do not summarize your plot in your title, and do not include a TL;DR in your post.** 

***

* **Tags (example: [True], [real experience]) are not allowed.** 

***

* **You may only post once every 24 hours.** This includes posting different stories from different usernames and collaborations between different authors. Breaking the 24 hour rule without moderator approval may result in all of the posts being removed. 

 **Regarding collaborations:** If several authors are posting a series of stories that are directly connected, each story in the series must be posted 24 hours apart. You do not have to follow the 24 hour rule if another author posts their part of the collaboration and you want to post an unrelated story (as long as your last personal post is at least 24 hours old).

 If multiple authors have written a single story together to be posted from a single account, all authors involved in the collaboration must wait at least 24 hours before posting again, regardless of the username used.

***

* **Posts must be formatted so that they are readable.**

***

* **Report all posts that violate our rules and guidelines!**

***
***

**Comment Rules:**

* **Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. [Click here for more information on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/ooccomments)**

*** 

* **No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise).** If the formatting is off, report the post and mods will address it. 

***

* **Do not ask for proof or tl;dr’s.** 

***

* **No “backseat modding.”** If something breaks a rule, report it. This helps the mods keep track of rule-breaking and ensure users are being civil.


***

* **Be respectful to one another**

***

* **Comments must contribute to the discussion.** This means no joke comments. It also means your comment should have or make a point.

***

* **Report all comments that violate these rules.**

***

* **Read the [Reader FAQ](/r/nosleep/wiki/reader_faq)!**

***

**Any violation of these rules will be met with appropriate discipline.**  Inappropriate posts and comments will be removed at moderator discretion.  Harassment of users, repeated rule violations, or reposting removed stories can and will result in a ban.

**About**

Warhammer 40k is a franchise created by Games Workshop, detailing the far future and the grim darkness it holds.

**Rules:**

1. *All GW universes are welcome* - 40k, AoS, Blood Bowl, etc. however....
1. *Posts should be relevant* - Posts should be related to GW and be humorous.  This should extend beyond the title.  Irrelevant posts will be removed.
1. *Tag any questionable material as NSFW* - Be respectful of those browsing in places where a scantily clad Battle Sister would be hard to explain.
1. *Direct links only*- You may not link to images in blogs etc. unless it is a direct link to the image.
1. *Political posts are allowed*- Any relevant post is allowed, however political posts will be locked by the mods to prevent them degrading into heresy.

Threads where video or photo is visible from the event must be spoiler flair'd so it is not visible.  While a TV show or live event is in progress, discussion must be kept in the live discussion thread.  Violations will result in a 1 week ban.  

* **NO TROLLING:** Trolling is an instant ban.

* **DOWNVOTE != DISLIKE:** If you don't agree with content posted, please feel free to challenge it in the comments, however do not downvote posts you disagree with. If the content is offensive, feel free to report it. **NOTE: We are *not* trying to tell you how to vote. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/3rt4id/meta_rules_reports_and_reprimanding/cwrlpeh) for more info.**

* **REPORT OFFENSIVE/SPAMMY/BAD CONTENT:** This subreddit will be a better environment for new/discussion if substandard content is reported. You can send a link to the content via modmail or use Reddit's reporting system to report a post.

* **RESPECT OTHERS**: This includes the staff. Disrespecting users will result in a 1 day ban.  Disrespecting or attacking moderators and admins will result in a ban.

* **LINK KARMA**: Do not post links with images about discussions just for link karma. Posts like this will be removed.

* **CLICK-BAIT**: In addition to link posts, be sure the title of a text post is reflective of the post's content. A discussion post called something like *Here's an idea...* is like a craigslist ad called *Here's something to buy*. Users should have an idea of your post's content without clicking on it.

* **SPAM POLICY:** Basically, we don't want you flooding the subreddit with several posts in a space of time from your own site.  Do not spam YouTube videos, blogs, podcasts, etc. Violation of this rule will result in removal of posts and/or banning. Please [**contact the mods**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/WWE&subject=Link Request&message=Hi there, I'd like to post a link that may be considered spam. The link is /PUT YOUR LINK HERE\ - could you check it and make sure it's okay before I post it? Thanks!) if you would like to post a link that could be considered spam. **Please make sure you read [Reddit's content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and [self promotion policy](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (especially [this line](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion#wiki_but_it.27s_not_spam.21__i_worked_hard_on_that.2C_i_make_no_money_from_it.2C_it.27s_original_content.21__i.27m_not_a_spammer.21)) before posting.**

* **NO STREAMING SITES:** Do not ask for, post or share links to sites streaming PPVs and shows.  Links will be deleted as spam and those sharing/asking for illegal stream links will be banned.

* **ENRICHMENT POLICY:** The subreddit does not allow links where the primary purpose is to promote or sell a product.  This especially applies to links to merchandise (except wwe.com), SEO, and affiliate links. 

* **NO ABUSE:**  Personal Threats and Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.  This includes posting personal information and brigading against any online or real life target.

* **NO DEFACED WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES:** This includes any joke edits or unproven rumors.

###Rules

* Only post Adventure Time related content.

* Keep any and all non-official links to episodes and comics of adventure time off of the subreddit‏. Do not ask for, nor give such links. Links of this nature will be removed and the poster will receive a warning. *This includes site names, and links to other parts of the site.* Also do not make posts asking ""Where can I view episodes?"" The answer is Amazon, Hulu, Itunes, DVDs, or Cartoon Network. If you have any other concerns message the mods.

* Absolutely no racism, sexism, sexual harassment, bigotry, or homophobia. We have a zero tolerance policy for it.

* No meme posts/image macros, MRW, MFW or any garbage posting.

* Absolutely no NSFW content allowed. If you're linking to a blog or the like that may also contain NSFW content in places other than the linked content itself please tag it clearly as so.

* Reposts are okay as long as it has been 1 month since the previous has been posted.

* New accounts have a 1 week probation period. You will not be allowed to post for the first 7 days of the creation of an account. 

* Please tag your post if it includes a spoiler from the show or comic. 4 days after an episode airs or comic comes out in the US, it is no longer considered a spoiler. Spoilers in titles are frowned upon, but are allowed a week after an episode airs. Not before. Do not post unofficial content on episodes before they air. This includes discussion posts about leaked episodes. All leaked content is banned from the sub. If you post a spoiler from a leaked episode (as in before it has aired) this is a double offense and will be a permaban. [See this page for more info on our spoiler policy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/wiki/spoilers)

* You are not allowed to advertise your personal merchandise or link to contests without moderator permission. Send us a message and we'll be happy to allow your post if it is appropriate.

* You are expected to follow proper [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and treat each other with dignity and respect.

* Please try to source your images by linking to the original source and not an imgur rehost. Give credit to the creator!

* No mentioning of leaked content whatsoever unless it's in a containment thread.

* **People who violate any of these rules will receive 1 warning. A second violation will result in a temporary or perma-ban. Mods have the right to wave the warning ONLY if the user is blatantly disrespecting the rules. You may attempt to appeal your ban if you feel you have been wrongly banned.**
&nbsp;

#Next New Episode

1. Do not ask for help to enact some sort of petty revenge!  This includes telling a story and ending with ""What would you have done?"", ""What are your thoughts?"", ""Any other ideas?""  All direct and indirect requests for ideas will result in a ban.

2. ***Stories*** should be **revenge**-based. **Karma =/= Revenge** Someone has wronged you, but you got your revenge, oh yes, you got your revenge. (If you have planned a revenge and need feedback, might I direct you to /r/myevilplan?)  Reporting someone to the police is **not** revenge, it is simply just reporting someone to the police.

3. ""You"" does not have to be you personally; posts relating to your friends, or good stories elsewhere on the internet, are fair game, as long as you're clear whose story it is.

4. ***Stories*** should be **petty**. I messed with their toothpaste. I turned their disk upside-down in their XBox. I *gasp* put shaving cream in their shoes. The more creative the better, (If you have a not so-petty revenge, post it in /r/prorevenge!)

5. ***Stories*** should **not** be serious. No: murder, rape, assault, grand theft (*petty* theft acceptable), or any other felonies.  **NO VANDALISM.**

6. ***Stories*** should be true. If a claim seems impossible or probably false, you will be asked for proof.

7. Racism, sexism, and other bigotry will not be tolerated, either in posts or in comments.

8. No identifying information (stay in compliance with [all Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq)).

9. NSFW posts should be labeled as such. NSFL posts probably aren't petty, but if you have a weird exception, label it appropriately.

10. No flame wars. Seriously, why do I have to specify this? Keep it classy, people!

11. No comments with the purpose of telling OP to x-post the post to another subreddit, **the comment will be removed**, send him/her a PM instead.  (This includes comments and/or statements similar to ""This is borderline <blank>"", ""/r/<blank>"", or ""If you would've <blank> it would've been <blank>"", or ""/r/<blank> would love this"")

Have a story of a revenge gone wrong? post it in /r/backfiredrevenge!

Or have a malicious story with or without revenge? post it in /r/badpeoplestories!

Or maybe you got your revenge in a video-game! post it in /r/GamersRevenge!

**General rules and suggestions:**

* No 9/11 jokes, as it was over a decade ago.
* If your post or comment contains blood, tits, or better, tag that post **[nsfw]**.
* Have someone to add on the Death Watch? Just [send the mods a PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftoosoon) and we'll get right on it.
* **DO NOT** submit posts that play on saying something literally too soon (ie. Merry Christmas while it's weeks away).
* No ""shooting spree counter"" images, original content is preferred.
* If you don't get something or you don't feel something is toosoon then downvote it. ""This isn't toosoon"" isn't helpful - maybe try finding or creating something you feel is toosoon and posting that!
* If you're not sure whether or not a link you're about to post is too soon, then just post it in /r/Imgoingtohellforthis.

**/r/NetflixBestOf is not an archive.**  Reposts are not only allowed, but are encouraged to some extent.  The front page of this subreddit is meant to be a living representation of quality content on Netflix and you might see the same submissions multiple times.  The mods are leaving it up to the community to utilize downvotes if they feel that reposts are too excessive. **Stop complaining about reposts and stop messaging the mods about it.**  If the same title appears simultaneously in the top 50, it may be removed at the mod's discretion.  

1.  **Submissions must be titled**. Please link to the description page of the movie or show you are posting.
[Correct formatting can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/2w5g6b/meta_a_slight_change_to_title_formatting_2015/)

2.  Please write a short blurb either in the submission title or the text if you do a self post to explain why this movie/show is worth watching.

3.  This subreddit is for Netflix instant watch only (All regions instant watch is available are welcome to post. Just make sure you use the correct regional tag in the title.). Please redirect items only available for disc to /r/netflix.

4. Add spoiler tags as a courtesy. [This is a spoiler] and follow that bracket with (/spoiler). Hover over to [read](/spoiler).

5. Add regional flair tags to your submissions so we know what Netflix region you're posting from [CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/2vqf1c/regional_flair/)

6.  This should be obvious, but **DO NOT RECOMMEND THINGS THAT ARE NOT ON INSTANT WATCH.**  There may be regional discrepancies, but do not intentionally recommend things that are not available on your instant watch. 

7.  Post spoilers, get banned

The main purpose of this subreddit is for recommendations for instant watch.  **However, useful and thoughtful posts regarding Netflix in general are tolerated.**",1131722,False

#**===========RULES===========**

1. THREAD RELEVANCE | 
---|
Do not submit threads not related to the items above.  If in doubt ask a moderator. |

2. COMMENTS MUST BE SERIOUS AND ON TOPIC|
---|
**(A)** In order to prevent [FORUM SLIDING](https://imgur.com/cVZzYCK) or [TOPIC DILUTION](https://imgur.com/Suq3sOT), the top 10 comments to any thread must be [serious] and on topic.  **(B)** The top 5 child comments to the top 10 comments must abide by the same guideline.  **(C)** Non-serious or non-related comments may be posted under the stickied mod comment on the top of any thread, or after the first 10/5.  If a mod has not done so yet, please refrain until it is up. [[Serious] Tag Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h93kd/announcing_a_new_option_for_posts_serious_tags/?st=jstdaobq&sh=1bc6f3fc). **(1)** Do not post anything off-topic or any jokes, **(2)** Downvote any comments violating that, and **(3)** Report those comments as well.  |

3. HUMOR |
---|
Humor is allowed within the confines of rule #2.  Elsewhere, please keep the humor light and fresh instead of lazy puns, jokes, and phrases constantly repeated on Reddit.  This is not the place.  For humor visit r/The_Mueller. |

4. NO LINK-ONLY POSTS | 
---|
Submissions must include more than a URL link(s). It is best to write your own summary, including the significance of the submission, but copying-and-pasting from articles will suffice if it provides adequate context [[example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/9ys4ud/how_to_write_a_good_post/)]. |

5. EVENT SUMMARIES |
---|
Summarize 1 topic at a time when possible.  All summaries must be sourced. Justification for an unorthodox, rare or highly-partisan source must be given.  Not all sources are equal.  The rhetoric of each summary belongs to its writer and is required to remain neutral, non-speculative and non-commentary. |

6. OVERVIEWS/TIMELINES | 
---|
Aim for readability and succinctness.  Formatting is half the battle.  Be neutral and refrain from speculation. |

7. HELP OTHERS |
---|
Users are encouraged to comment on a story's significance, impact or how the development relates to other events.  Help refine member write-ups by proposing suggestions or corrections, and source your comments or claims when applicable. |

8. AD HOMINEM |
---|
Users are discouraged from using ad hominem attacks against any entity above or any user.  If your passion gets the better of you, please use such attacks as a last resort, at a minimum, and followed with something justifying it. |

9. IMMEDIATE BANS |
---|
Ruthless permanent banning of anyone that partakes in obvious trolling, suspected propaganda, far-right talking points, demoralizing pessimism, or intentional [propaganda techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques) or [disinformation](https://imgur.com/sFQJX1W) [tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation).  This sub is curated to enable factual and undistracted discussion.  Skepticism or dissent is allowed if presented rationally and [in good faith](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/in--good--faith).  If you believe you were banned unjustly please message the moderators. |

* All of the above rules are subject to revision if the community deems it necessary after a constructive discussion.

* Collaborate, cooperate, chronicle.

##Discover the Music
A great place to start discovering synthwave is the earlier mentioned [Synthwave Essential Album Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/85vgby/synthwave_essential_album_chart_ver_30_update/?st=jffow3nf&sh=48f23b28).

But that list only shows the tip of the iceberg. Synthwave/Retrowave/Outrun is much bigger than that. [The official /r/outrun playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/outrun_reddit/playlist/7n520GFnC94Pvyno52ePSl?si=wzW_TFsbTmGvZ5VLNa6Ehg) where we collect all synthwave music has more than 7000 tracks (530+Hours) of music on it. 

We realize that list is way too big to easily discover new artists, which is why we made the [""Synthwave Discover Playlist""](https://open.spotify.com/user/vaaggaav/playlist/6nPnRHK0jikKfATrnQMtqb?si=tM1p6HcYTxinorvjr_BXow), which only has a maximum of 3 tracks of the same artist. 820 tracks (60 hours) which means the list contains over 270 different synthwave artists.

Another great resource to discover new music is the weekly updated [Nightride FM playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/7nuzg0h0r6660ajs8j07phpqe/playlist/5mf3GZeiiO0AEFQAtmYnMK?si=wCZ33LcGTfWMYyknwoouEw). Every week a new guest DJ (artists or other prominent figures in the scene) takes the reigns on nightride FM and present their personal top 40 playlist. 

More good playlists on spotify that we recommend are [""Synthwave in Space""](https://open.spotify.com/user/aofd3/playlist/4sgUux9hmykyWYmVoe4W6p?si=3wqvhe7DSSyMpKyAqjrBKA) playlist by aof3d or his [""Synthwave Underground""](https://open.spotify.com/user/aofd3/playlist/1yqSYlnLwg8waxkVIdSSZT?si=Lz0fEhlGTvqvjRQ4DuJ5OA) playlist consisting of lesser known synthwave artists.

We also recommend the [synthwave playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1213866633/playlist/6aQpDzlGkoI9VIqRepZSZy?si=4Oo7hQF5Ti2NpiP4maM9pQ) by Iron Skullet. He writes music reviews over at [Ironskullet.com](https://ironskullet.com), an expert of the scene!

If you want music reviews, intervies, podcasts and more check out [vehlinggo.com](https://vehlinggo.com). For instance check out the [interview/article he did on the Drive soundtrack](https://vehlinggo.com/2016/09/07/drive-movie-fifth-anniversary-feature/) where he interviews producers College, Electric Youth, Johnny Jewel (Chromatics/Desire) and Cliff Martinez who contributed to the OST.

If you really want to get into the thick of things check out the awesome live Synthwave shows on [mixlr.com/power85](http://mixlr.com/power85/). Every thursday 3PM EST the Who-Ha kicks it off with [Vox Populi](https://soundcloud.com/voxpopulithepodcast) followed by Andy Synth with [Beyond Synth](https://soundcloud.com/beyond-synth) at 5PM EST. Where they interview producers, play music and have a laugh in the chat.

Or check out the [Retro Electro Show on Kiss FM Australia](https://kissfm.com.au/show/dreamcore).  Its at the core of the synthwave scene in Australia!

Youtube is also a great way to discover new music, there are many good youtube channels. Most notably:

- [NewRetroWave](https://www.youtube.com/newretrowave)

- [Luigi Donatello](https://www.youtube.com/user/LuigiDonatello)

- [The 80s guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ghlxmJNMd8BE_u1HR-bTg)

- [The Prime Thanatos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYTgpKxd-QOJCPDrmaXuqQ)

- [Neon Nights](https://www.youtube.com/NeonNightsChannel)

- [RetroSynth](https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroSynthMusic)

If you want a continues stream of synthwave check out [the synthwave station on Digitally Imported Radio](https://www.di.fm/synthwave) curated by our very own mod /u/liamemsa.

Or visit [Drive Radio](http://driveradio.be/), they offer a 24/7h stream, media coverage including interviews and news and the creators of Drive Radio also run the label [Lazerdiscs Records](https://lazerdiscs.bandcamp.com/). 

[Recall FM](http://www.recallfm.com) is doing something similar,  blogs/interviews and a music [on their youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCphfinyJX-eKQ6mjpMN_AuQ/videos)

Or listen to [RetroWave Radio](http://retrowave.ru/)'s endless synthwave stream, where you can also skip songs as you please.

A link is considered a repost if,

1. It is already in the hall of fame in the sidebar.

If you see a repost, please click on the report button and fill in the box ""repost"". After this, we will decide whether to delete the post or not! (The word ""repost"" followed by an irrelevant funny one-liner is not necessary but will give us a good laugh). Please don't post a comment saying: ""Jesus, this is the 100th time this picture has been posted"". Just use the report button and that's it!

**History and Basic Info** 
 
The Golden Retriever is a medium sized dog which was historically used to retrieve animals for hunting parties. Their name was instilled by their love of water and ability to retrieve animals undamaged.

Golden Retrievers have a dense inner coat providing them with warmth and a way to repel water off their body. They are intelligent, and playful thus making them the 5th most popular dog in the United States and 8th in the UK. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever)

#####[Submit Text Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bertstrips/submit?selftext=true&sidebar)

#Rules:

**1.)** All posts submitted must have clear, readable text. Your post must also be properly formatted, with the image on top and the text on the bottom. [[Click for Example]](http://i.imgur.com/MkqcgJI.png)

**2.)** All posts must be submitted to RES compatible sites, such as Imgur and Gfycat.

**3.)** ""Fixed"" posts, **reposts**, and photoshopped images, are not allowed. Images may not be altered in any way, other than adding text. Any post that violates this criteria **can result in a ban.** As a general rule of thumb, if you did not make the Bertstrip on your own then it has **most likely** been posted here before.

**4.)** All images must come directly from Sesame Street, The Muppets, or Fraggle Rock. You may use images of characters that come from official sources and related materials, such as news stories, movies, Golden Books, etc. Do not post images of action figures, toys, or video game screenshots. Please do not post images originating from fan works, only official sources.

**5.)** Please limit yourself to posting no more than 2 Bert Strips in a 24 hour period.

**6.)** If you wish to post more than 2 images in a single day, consider posting them as a [Bert Stories post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/bertstrips/comments/2hq51j/bert_stories_a_better_way_to_post_bert_strips/)

**7.)**  Please use the tag [GIF] when posting animated Bert Strips.

**8.)**  If you see /u/Valladian, tell him to post more Bert Strips. He's been getting lazy.

####**Rules**

- Be civil. This is a forum for Giants fans and those interested in the Giants. Trolls will not be tolerated.

- Check the new queue before posting. Duplicate posts will be removed.

- When submitting a new post, the title should describe the submission.  The purpose of a title is so people reading it (and looking for it) will know what they will find inside without any unnecessary clutter. Make sure that your title does that as best as possible by avoiding editorialization, misleading wording, or false titles intended as a joke.

- All news should be sourced. Sources, in this situation, mean something you can link to.

- When submitting a Twitter post as a thread, include the author of the tweet, as well as the full text of the tweet in your thread title.

- You can be a redditor with a website but not a website with a reddit account. Message the mods with your submission before posting. We reserve the right to remove any blog posts, Twitter chains, podcasts, etc. that do not contribute to the subreddit.

- This subreddit will loosely follow /r/nfl's policies on memes and gifs. Please do not spam either of the two.

This is not a satirical or circlejerk subreddit. This is a normal casual Linux subreddit with some satirical & humor elements.

Looking for help? Check /r/linux4noobs and /r/linuxquestions, they have more subscribers you'll find help there easier.

Want to learn about linux? https://linuxjourney.com/

**About**

A subset of the Glorious PC Master Race, the Linux Master Race promotes the glorious operating systems that run using the free and open source Linux kernel. Linux differs from the disgustingly proprietary operating systems like Windows and Mac OS by being open and freely influenced by anyone with the necessary desire and abilities.

**Why use Linux?**

* Less malware than OSX and Windows.
* It's faster and more efficient than OSX and Windows.
* No bloatware included.
* You can make your desktop look however you want. [Literally](/r/unixporn).
* You can update all your computer's software with a single click.
* Runs on pretty much anything, no matter how old it is.
* You can see every line of code it uses, so you know there's no NSA backdoor.  [They tried (and failed) to get a backdoor inserted into Linux](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/19/linux_backdoor_intrigue/). There are also no keyloggers built-in, [unlike in Windows](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-windows-technical-preview-data,27816.html)
* It costs exactly $0.
* According to Gabe Newell, it's the future of PC gaming (as is [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown)).
* By using it, you ascend even higher into the /r/PCMasterRace
* [Read more](http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/)
* [Also check our wiki (WIP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/wiki/index)



**Rules**


We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

\#1) Respect the privacy of others.  
\#2) Think before you type.  
\#3) With great power comes great responsibility.   

For expansions on the three basic rules, view [the full rules page here](http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/wiki/rules).

Additionally, posts that are Microsoft/Windows related may only be posted on Mondays.  Posts including Microsoft/Windows that also relate to Linux might be allowed according to moderator discretion.

# Please check that it is Monday on UTC before posting something MS or Windows related!

**I use Windows or Mac alongside Linux.  Can I join the Linux Master Race?**

* Alas, currently the Mac squids, and even more so the Windows krill, do not realize the inevitable triumph of the Linux OS.  This is an unfortunate fact, and it may force many penguins to use the crude systems of the seafood.  Even if persecuted in this way, as long as one believes in the supremacy of Linux, one may become a member of the Linux Master Race. One day the trials will end and we shall rise above all, but use the systems of the squids and krill for what you need and only for what you need, and persevere in the hope of the future.

>**1B.** Please do not name, share or discuss unauthorized signing services on r/jailbreak. As of right now, the only approved signing service is [jailbreaks.fun](http://jailbreaks.fun/). Many signing services host pirated App Store apps, apps rehosted without the permission of the developer, or maliciously modified apps. [Why?](https://redd.it/91w74c/)

>**1C.** r/jailbreak will not support developers who malpractice licenses, tweaks and etc. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/ah0bzv/meta_updates_on_drama_and_developer_malpractice/)

### 2. Themes (and theme-related questions or news), setup showcases, and all questions regarding aesthetic-oriented tweaks should be posted in r/iOSthemes.    

### 3. No misleading/all-caps titles, and titles must contain at least three words (excluding tags). [Titles must include tags.](/r/jailbreak/wiki/approvedtags)    
>Use detailed titles for both news and questions. Also, link to the source of news, such as the developer who made the announcement, instead of linking to blogspam.
  
>Posts without tags will be automatically removed by AutoModerator.

  >Tags let readers automatically hide posts using [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) and sort through topics that interest them.

### 4. No exceptionally low-effort posts.
>No memes, image macros, DAE posts, karma-farming, or shitposts. Similar low-quality/low-effort posts will be removed. Please read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5.3A_dank_memes_.26amp.3B_low-effort_content) for clarification.

### 5. No posts or comments about removing passcodes from locked devices,  bypassing Activation Lock or removing IMEI lock.     
>History has shown that these situations usually involve a stolen device, and the mods are not able to verify individual cases.

### 6. Do not buy/sell devices or ask for money here.      
>If you wish to buy/sell a jailbroken device, visit r/jailbreakswap.

### 7. Be civil and friendly.    
>No insulting/rude, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. comments or posts. Additionally, do not be rude or unhelpful when responding to posts tagged [Question].

### 8. Topic must be jailbreak-related.    
>Posts must be directly related to jailbreaking (with [some exceptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_posts_not_related_to_ios_jailbreaking.)).

### 9. Read the FAQ and search before posting.    
>Posts that ask the most frequently asked questions will be removed by moderators, as they are either answered in our [FAQ](/r/jailbreak/wiki/faq) or on the sidebar.

********************************
> ## Frequently-Asked Questions
>Please read our **[Disneyland FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/wiki/index)** before posting any non-discussion questions.

>***Check out this [cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18834IUa6xm0IVEZsVZsL2aO8OgnofK8l4WQlwkiGPFo/edit), compiled by the /r/Disneyland community!***

> -**Recent Topics**-

********************************

> ##Rules
>**1. Posts should directly relate to the Disneyland Resort**, located in Anaheim, CA. Remember, just because it's Disney doesn't mean it's about Disneyland. This includes merchandise and things you made. 

>**2. Read the FAQ  and use the search bar before posting a question**. Posts that have obviously done neither are subject to removal.

>**3. Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and keep it clean.** Try to maintain a family environment. Bullying or Harassment of any kind will result in a ban. This includes telling anyone to ""fuck off"", new accounts created solely for complaining, and ""[Trolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll)"". For further clarification, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/9mhc2k/rule_3_clarification/).

>**4. Posts should follow [reddit's rules on self-promotion](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and should refrain from being ""blogspam.""** If you are attempting to post, you must have history in the subreddit or else it is subjected for removal. You will be banned on your second violation.

>**5. No Reposts.** One post per discussion topic. Due to recent abuse, you may only post once per day (Exceptions can be made and are up to mod approval). Park photos/Trip Reports must be condensed into one album.

>**6/7. NSFW content is not permitted, so ""NSFW"" on this subreddit is used as a shorthand for ""Not Safe for Magic.""** Any post which can ""ruin the magic"" (such as any behind-the-scenes pictures or videos) should be marked ""NSFW"" as a courtesy gesture to users who may not want to have the magic spoiled for them.

>**8. Posts about rule breaking at the parks are frowned upon.** This includes asking Cast Members and others for help getting into the parks or trying to get access/reservations to Club 33. This sort of behavior will be considered harassment and can result in a ban, as per **Rule #3**. (/r/Disneyland CMs, please message the moderators if you feel you are being harassed.)

>**9. IAMAs:** Want to submit an IAMA post? Please message the mods first.

>*We respect our users, and wish to provide a positive environment. If you do not agree with our philosophies, and only wish to promote unhappiness in the happiest place on Earth, please show yourself out.*

>Posts violating the rules will be removed!

> **If you believe your post has been caught in the spam filter, please wait 24 hours before messaging the moderators.**

> /r/Disneyland is a fan-run subreddit and has no official affiliation with the Walt Disney Company or any related companies.

2rub3,t5_2rub3,PrettyGirls,"> Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not. -Ralph Waldo Emerson

-----
We believe in a holistic approach to beauty - self-posts are welcomed and encouraged, as are positive comments of any kind.

Please help engender a kind and safe space and respect our zero-tolerance policy on harassment.

Thank you - it truly helps us build a better community for everyone.


#####We welcome your posts, however, the rules are strictly enforced. Take a look around and get a feel for this subreddit before you post. Please read the rules thoroughly before you post, you can be banned on your first rule violation. 
---
>Rules  
  
|||
|:------|:-----|
|1) The subject must be an adult and know they are being photographed. | Thank you for helping us ensure every individual photographed did so with autonomy and individual accord.
|2) NSFW content is not allowed. | This includes partially see-through clothing, visible underwear, and in some cases form-fitting clothing. Images may not be cropped to comply with this rule
|3) No cleavage or excessive skin. | If there's cleavage, excessive skin, or implied nudity in your image, chances are it will do well at any of the hundreds of other subreddits that allow the sexy and the risque. Images may not be cropped to comply with this rule. 
|4) One image per post | Albums and collages are not allowed. Images must be directly linked to; no albums are allowed in the comments. 
|5) Negative, harassing, political, and sexual comments are not allowed. | This includes bullying, bigotry, misogyny, misandry, transphobia, homophobia, racism, rating, political comments of any kind, or otherwise negative comments. Spoilers are not allowed. Please be respectful and civil, and refrain from inappropriate or unnecessarily hurtful comments.
|6) All links must follow rules 1-4. | This includes links to twitter, facebook, subreddits, etc. If **any photo** violates the other rules, the link will be removed. Instagram links or usernames are not allowed in this sub at all.
|7) Quality Standards | Posts must meet certain quality standards. They must be able to be opened by RES. They may not be excessively photoshopped, poorly cropped, low resolution, screenshots, watermarked, etc. No image filters. Titles may not violate other rules, or be of a low-quality nature. Pandering titles will be removed.   
|8) Reposts are not allowed| It is your job to verify that you are not reposting images in this sub. Reposting top 100 images results in an automatic ban. Other images are subject to the internal moderator policy on dealing with reposts. 
|9) Moderator Discretion| Moderators have the final say in whether or not an image or comment is acceptable for this subreddit. If a post does not fit a more defined rule, this rule can be invoked as a removal reason.

36znx,t5_36znx,holdmyfries,"##**How this subreddit works:**    

   1. **All post should start with the ""HMF"" format.**

   2. **Posts should include an example of a ""hold my fries"" moment. The person in the post must be overweight while trying to perform a feat, and either succeeding or failing. DO NOT just post a picture of a fat person.** 

   3. **No death, extreme injury or gore, or harm to animals. If it's NSFW please tag it as such. Porn will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and potentially allowed ONLY if it contains a very relevant HMF moment.**

   4. **No reposts from /r/HoldMyFries that are in the top 100 posts or less than 3 months old. You can check for them [here](http://karmadecay.com/r/holdmyfries?url=ref). Repeat violators will receive a ban.**

   5. **This is meant to be a casual sub, please don't take everything seriously. Though, telling anyone to ""kill themselves"" or eliciting harm to another will result in a 7 day ban. Repeat offenders will be permanently banned. Their cholesterol is probably doing that already.**

   6. **Outright hate speech, racism, or bigotry will result in a 7 day ban. Repeat offenders will be permanently banned. We are a ""Hold My ..."" subreddit featuring overweight people, and not a fat person hating subreddit.**

The Elder Scrolls (commonly referred to as TES) is an award-winning series of roleplaying games created by Bethesda Softworks. Set in the vast world of Nirn, The Elder Scrolls series is renowned for the level of unprecedented control given the player over his or her character's destiny, establishing itself as the benchmark in immersive, independently-living worlds for the RPG genre.

###### Rules & Guidelines ######

>1. You are free to joke around and banter, but going out of your way to agitate, humiliate, doxx, or insult another user is a bannable offense. Follow reddiquette.

>2. Off-topic discussion (Included but not limited to irl politics, religion, real world issues) is banned. You can discuss it to a light level in the comments but any heated debates will be pruned

>3. All NSFW content must be properly labeled. NSFW content is fine, but if it the post is explicitly pornography or sexual in nature it will be removed. Please refer to any of the NSFW Elder Scrolls themed subreddits out there.

>4. Promoting your playthroughs, streams, documentaries, reviews is fine as long as you keep yourself to a maximum of one post every 2 days in order to prevent spam.

>5. Any product codes or keys given as give aways, raffles or contests should be sent privately. This is to prevent bots from snatching them up automatically. However begging for free games/expansions is prohibited. This subreddit does not exist for your personal gain.

>6. Game spoilers are allowed but please be considerate when discussing spoilers around people who have yet to finish the games. If around newcomers spoiler tags are highly encouraged. When TES6 is released, a stricter spoiler system will be implemented.

>7. No illegal file sharing such as pirated software, cracks and store content. Discussion is okay as long as names of and links to specific websites are not posted. Any content made by users or mods, even items from donation or paysites reuploaded for free, is allowed.

>8. No next game rumours. Speculation is welcome, but we don't want a subreddit full of rumours being reported as facts unless there is substantial evidence that it is true. All text posts regarding speculation or suggestions for the next game go into the TES6 Speculation Megathread.

>9. Flair your posts properly and appropriately. This is to ease navigation and sorting of the sub's posts.

**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:**

Questions regarding setups, equipment advice, or personal inquiries that primarily benefit the individual over the broader subreddit community should be submitted in the stickied *Weekly Questions* thread, also accessible from the *Submit a New Question* button above. Be sure to use the search bar to browse for your answer - you just may find what you're looking for!

Photo and image posts as well as gifs and short videos must also include a 300+ character description, story, or review of their content. Posts without adequate description will be removed automatically. If your post is removed you can still add a 300+ character comment with the description and it will be approved automatically. A list of album titles is not an adequate description.

No meme or rage comic image posts. Feel free to post them in the comments.

Posts specifically intending to buy, sell, or trade vinyl or stereo equipment are not permitted. Please visit /r/vinylcollectors in order to sell, trade, and seek albums.

Do not make a post to share download codes. These belong in /r/downloadcodes!

**Harassment Policy:** It is inevitable that users will appear from all walks and times in life, causing us to have disagreements. This can lead to constructive, unique and enjoyable content and we sincerely encourage you to share your opinions based on experience. However, harassment against other users of any kind is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. If you find yourself in a conversation that is moving toward *personal* differences and confrontation, please have the mindfulness to remove yourself from the situation. Please report harassment as such so that we can investigate.

**Post get removed?** [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23vinyl) so that we can check it out for you.

**General Rules**

https://www.reddit.com/r/astronomy/wiki/rules

Posters should make every effort to link to primary sources or reputable reporting on said sources. Tertiary sources or or sources whose content is lifted verbatim from a secondary sources, as well as secondary sources from disreputable, overly click-baity, or ad-filled sources will be removed. Users repeatedly posting links to a single source to drive traffic to their sites will be banned.

When posting news, please verify that the topic hasn't already been posted in the past few days.

Rage/Meme Comics, disrespectful and overly political comments will be removed.

Please avoid multiple exclamation marks, excessive CAPS, or editorializing in submission titles.

While we welcome pics to this community, the focus of the sub is tilted towards astronomy as a discipline. As such, we typically remove pictures that are not of an exceptional quality (i.e., likely no cell phone. Pictures should have good composition, focus, resolution...). Original Photos should include acquisition information. Other images must link to the original source (ie, Hubble, NASA, etc...). If your photos do not meet these guidelines, consider posting in /r/photos, /r/astrophotography, or /r/spaceporn.

/r/Astronomy is a science based sub. Pseudoscience (Creationism, Electric Universe, Flat Earthism, Ancient Aliens, Moon Landing conspiracy, etc...) will be removed. Similarly, this is not the place for half baked ""theories.""

Repeat and/or serious offenses will earn you a ban.

   Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, speciesism, and religion. Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.

If you are not yet familiar with anarchism, check out our [primer](/r/Anarchism/wiki/primer) or /r/Anarchy101.  

If you want to debate, try /r/DebateAnarchism.

/r/Anarchism is for discussing topics relevant to anarchism. The moderation structure and policies are not intended to be an example of an anarchist society; an internet forum is not a society. If you join the discussion here, we assume that you are an anarchist, an ally, or want to learn more about anarchism. Review the 
[**Anti-Oppression Policy**](/r/Anarchism/wiki/aop) to see how you can help make space for marginalized people.

# /r/puns Rules

1. **Do not post in all caps.**  Puns aren't funnier at higher volume.

2. **Metric measurements only.**  Unless the pun specifically involves Imperial terms, in which case, go wild.

3.  **Don't repost things.**  Excessive reposts or repeats of jokes made within the last 30 days are subject to removal.

4.  **Don't plagiarize.**  We know not everything can be original, but don't claim credit for something you didn't create.

5.  **No spam.**  Does this even need to be said?

6.  **Post must be a pun and must be explained *in the comments*.**  If your post or image isn't self-explanatory, you must comment on it with enough information for readers to get the joke.

7. **DO NOT PLACE THE PUNCHLINE IN THE TITLE.**  Your post will be removed if you do this, unless it's a very obvious one-liner.  If any kind of image is involved, placing the punchline in the title will always result in removal of your post.

8.  **We need to know what's dirty *before* we click on it.**  Please flag your posts as NSFW if they contain language or imagery that isn't suitable for viewing in public or by viewers under 18.
   
___
As of now, we do not have a rule regarding racism or other 'politically incorrect' topics. This is subject to change, provided your fellow punsters do not abuse our current good behavior. However, please keep your jokes in good taste, and keep them around a PG level. If your joke is a bit more insensitive, use the NSFW tag. I will not remove any jokes that are NSFW tagged provided they do not break any of the other rules!

Dreams of the future reveal more about the mind of the dreamer than the future itself. 

This subreddit focuses on the futurist visions of eras past.  However posts may also contain contemporary art with a retrofuturist theme. 

Futurism was born out of humanity's reaction to a sudden thrust into technological revolution. To the many that witnessed the rapid change, it seemed technological utopia was fast approaching.  This unbridled optimism caused the collective imagination to run wild.  

Although many of these visions seem almost comical now - the spirit in which they were created is part of the reason you are currently looking into a glowing rectangle with unlimited, instant access to the sum of all human knowledge.

**POSTING GUIDELINES:**

**Vintage =/= Retrofuturism**

**Vintage Sci-fi =/= Retrofuturism**

Please avoid posting vintage technology, unless it has a intentionally and obviously ""futuristic"" design.  

I will work to prevent default sub syndrome: clickbait titling, meme-ification, etc.  So please watch the titling and try to be as informative as possible!  Vast majority of submissions have been perfect for the sub and the community is great.  Just want to nip any trends in the bud.  I reserve the right prune low-quality and/or questionable content to keep the frontpage looking good!

**Post only:**

**1. Futurist visions from eras past.**
  
**2. Contemporary art with a retrofuturist theme.**

**3. Discussion threads related to retrofuturism.**

**Rules:**

1. Play nicely. Please refrain from rude, offensive, or otherwise discourteous behaviour. This includes hate speech, ""flame-warring,"" or personal attacks. Comments violating this rule will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Repeated violations will result in a ban.

2. #**POSTS MUST BE CREEPY. JOKE ASTERISKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** 
Rule 2 Details: **(2a)** Screenshots must be forced or unsolicited actions. People agreeing to ""roleplay"" is not within the spirit of this sub. **(2b)** Posts depicting jokes or posts that aren't creepy will also be removed. **(2c)** As of april 16, 2018, ""I tried this on [person]"" posts are no longer allowed and will be removed (see rule 2a)

3. Ensure last names, identifiable usernames, and profile pictures are censored. If your post contains any information that can theoretically lead to someone being tracked down and subsequently doxxed, it will be removed.

4. Reposts are only allowed if the original post is more than 6 months old and not in the top 100. Any other repost will be removed. Serial reposters may be banned at moderator discretion.

5. No posts that say anything along the lines of ""See you on Reddit"".

##**Troubleshooting**

**If you CANNOT SEE ANY NSFW POSTS**

Change your account settings to enable NSFW content [by clicking here.](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/) 

Tick the 'I'm over 18 years old.....' box ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/qAPtyKeh.jpg)) and **SAVE** those settings.

---

##**What is Original5050?**

An Original5050 post provides two possibilities in the title with only one actual result. Since you don't know which you'll get until you click the link, you have a 50/50 chance of getting one or the other. When the sub first started, this was the only way to make 5050 posts. You can submit an Original5050 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).

##**What is True5050?**
 A True5050 post has two options in the title with two possible results. It will randomly pick and give users one of the two options. These posts are given a **[TRUE]** flair. Use [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) to create a True5050 post. 

**View Only True5050 Posts**

If you only want to browse True5050 posts, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiftyfifty/search?q=flair%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). This will filter out all Original5050 posts for you.

**Submit a True5050 post** 

Go to [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) and enter both options there. The site will generate a link, which will randomly switch between both outcomes. Submit this link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).

---

##**Rules for Comments**

**DO NOT** link the outcomes of any posts in the comments. Users that do so ***will be BANNED.*** This applies to True5050 and Original5050 posts. Asking for links/DMs is also banworthy.

----

##**Rules for Submissions**

**I. Titles MUST Include [50/50]**

>Your title must start with [50/50], have two clear options in your title (one must be good and one must be bad), and include either ""NSFL"", ""NSFW"" or ""SFW"".

>**One option should encourage people to click and the other option should discourage them from clicking.**

 **II. Only Use Approved Image Domains**

>Post should be hosted on [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Giphy](http://giphy.com), [Postimage](http://postimage.org), [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com), [Minus](http://minus.com), [YouTube](http://youtube.com), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk), [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) or directly on Reddit. 

**III. No Illegal Content (Linked or not)**

>Terrorist propaganda, animal/child cruelty, mutilation, rape, molestation, etc. is **NOT PERMITTED**, *even as the title of the option you didn't go with*.

**IV. Clear and Separate Titles**

>Posts must have **2 clear, descriptive, and accurate parts** that each deliver one outcome, not both. Users should know what to expect when they click. 

>""Outcome 1 | Outcome 1"" or animals that sound like body parts (Tit, Cock, Ass etc) will be removed. [Further details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/about/rules/). 

**V. Porn and Spoilers must be True5050**

>Anything that involves porn or sexualised nudity - in any way, shape or form - MUST be in True5050 form ([5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com)). 

**VI. Other Forbidden 5050s**

>Certain ""themes"" of posts that often show up will also be removed. Full list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/about/rules/).

>Some examples that are not permitted:

> \> [(Self-)Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (Instant perm ban)

> \> Memes, low effort or rick rolls 

> \> Mentioning your connection to the image (like ""My dog"")

**VII. Moderator discretion**

>Mods reserve the right to remove any offending post or comment *at their own discretion*. You may appeal any mod action taken against you, but you're not entitled to a response.

#Content Philosophy:
Content which benefits the community (news, rumors, and discussions) is valued
over content which benefits only the individual (technical questions, help
buying/selling, rants, self-promotion, etc.).  


---
#Rules:
####Hover for more info
###1. Only submissions that are directly related to Android are allowed.

###2. We welcome **discussion-promoting** posts that benefit the community, and not the individual.
- We welcome posts that benefit the community (device reviews, guides,
  discussions and rumors) and not the individual (rants, customer service
  complaints, or selling/trading devices).
- Low effort/""hit and run"" posts will be removed.
- Support questions, including app or phone recommendations, should go to
  /r/AndroidQuestions instead.
  Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the[ AOSP tracker.](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/report-bugs)

###3. Images must be in **self posts**.

###4. Developer self promotion must meet these guidelines.
- **Self promotion is meant for community members only**:
- - Your account must be at least 3 months old.
- - You must have a reasonable posting history (meaning you're an active redditor, and your posts aren't *just* to promote your app).
- - You will be expected to interact with users in your thread.
- - Your post must be a self post and provide a decent amount of information about your app. A few
    sentences and a link won't cut it.
- - Be reasonable with how often you promote your app.

###5. No reposts, spam or rehosted content.
- Duplicate posts on the same topic will be removed, even if it's a different
  source.
- For rehosted content, post the original source instead. This can usually be
  found at the bottom of the article.

###6. No **editorializing** titles.
- In most cases, you should use the same title as the article you're posting.

###7. No **piracy.**
- Download unverified APKs at your own risk.

###8. No **unauthorized** polls, surveys, bots, or giveaways.
- Message the moderators first if you'd like to submit any of these

###9. No offensive, hateful, or low-effort comments.  

###10. No affiliate links.
- Only non-""deal alert"" third-party articles may contain affiliate links.

**Game Overview**
***

""Darkest Dungeon is a hard-core RPG about the stresses of dungeon crawling. You must manage a team of flawed heroes through the horrors of being 500 feet underground while fighting unimaginable foes, famine, disease, and the encroaching dark.  You will have to tend to characters’ spirits as much as you do their Hit Points.  But in these grim situations arises the opportunity for true skill and heroism!""

***
**Posting Rules**
***

* Don't break [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/about/rules/) or the [rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules).

* Be mindful of  [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

* Do not post NSFW content. Mild gore is allowed.

* Do not submit Youtube gameplay videos or Twitch streams as a link post. They must be part of a text post with additional information as to why we should watch that video or stream. Videos of other content (speedpaint, cosplay, trailer, etc.) are fine to be posted as links.

* Do not beg or ask for game keys. You may be banned without warning.

* Do not post or ask for any place to download the game illegitimately. The game is cheap and often on sale.
  
* Pretty obviously, posts should relate to DD in some way, beyond the title.

* When posting, make sure the post is of some effort. Screenshots are fine, as long as they pose interest; and aren’t common occurences within the game.

* Give credit when posting an artist's work.

* [Use emotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/38cgaa/we_have_14_new_emotes/) responsibly.

* You can [join our Discord chat here](https://discord.gg/darkestdungeon).

* Read our [spoiler policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/41l3x2/when_and_how_to_mark_spoilers/)

1. **Stay on Topic, Don’t spam.** ^(Posts must be Doom related, and must be related in more than just the title. Please flair your posts with their respective categories.)
2. **No NSFL material. No porn.** ^(This sub is rated M for Mature, not AO for Adults Only.)
3. **No illegal content distribution.** ^(You know how this rules works.)
4. **Don’t be a dick, be civil.** ^(Let people have fun, and just be nice to your fellow redditors.)
5. **No cross community drama.** ^(We don't want to hear about how a different Doom community banned you.)

**Respect the staff’s authority even if there isn’t a specific rule.** ^(Just because there isn't a rule, that doesn't grant you the ability to be a smartass about it.)

##Emergency / Arbitrary Rules in standing

*Doom* is a series of sci-fi action/horror games from [id software](http://www.idsoftware.com/), starting with *Doom* in 1993, and continuing with Doom^3 and *Doom (2016)*.

In *Doom*, you play as a space marine tasked with defeating the unleashed demonic forces of Hell, using a variety of heavy weapons and your own skill against the invading hordes. *Doom* codified and revolutionized First-Person Shooters, and remains one of the most influential games in the genre.

Feel free to also discuss Doom-engine games such as Heretic, Hexen, and Strife, and any others. Please tag these posts with [*game name*], to make them easier to distinguish.

**Reminder:** Please use Post flairs to help others see what kind of content you're posting.

2x2xm,t5_2x2xm,AwesomeCarMods,"*If you want flair for the car you drive, message the mods with your request and we will see it done*

Rule 1. -- Don't post any shitty car mods. Those belong in /r/Shitty_Car_Mods. ""Shitty"" is a very subjective term and the mod team will do its best to stay subjective. Underneath the rules we will lay out our new criteria for posts.

Rule 2. -- Don't hate on other people's opinions of ""awesome"". Just because you wouldn't drive something doesn't mean that others feel the same. Instead of hate, offer downvotes to show your dislike. We will take this very seriously and anyone who offers direct hate will be given a temp-ban. Repeat offenders will be given a perma-ban. Telling someone that they posted in the wrong sub and should have posted in /r/Shitty_Car_Mods will not be tolerated, there are more appropriate ways to express dislike.

Rule 3. -- Have fun. 


Our new submission criteria: the car in the post must be at least two of these things or it will be removed.

1. Well done
2. Tasteful
3. Useful

Rule 4. --

No useless bickering over stance. Some of you love it, some of you hate it. But there's no need to senselessly clog up threads with the bickering. If you don't like it, just downvote and move on. 

As the mods, we reserve the right to decide if your post fits these criteria. If your post is removed, feel free to message us to appeal.
*********************************************************

If you have any problems posting, or really any concerns at all, feel free to message the moderators. You can either use the built in ""message the mods"", or send a moderator (jdibs77, VenusBlue, GrillBears, __celli and TheCrippledGirafffe) a Private Message. All messages will get a reply, due to this subreddit's extremely small user base.

Since the founder of this subreddit drives a Honda Del Sol, you should check out /r/DelSol. ",127882,False
2rq0f,t5_2rq0f,nsfw_gifs,"####Welcome to /r/nsfw_gifs!



**Submission Guidelines**: 

****

* All submissions must be a gif that contains at least suggestive nudity

* No anime or otherwise animated content (/r/rule34)

* No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors

* All submissions must be from an approved image host (imgur, gfycat, giphy, redd.it or reddituploads). You must link directly to the image

* No low-quality submissions

* No spam

* Don't be a dick (note: excessively being a dick may result in you getting banned, so don't do it)


If you see any post that breaks the rules, report it! Please include a reason when you report, or else it probably won't be removed.





**Have any suggestions? Let us know! [Send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nsfw_gifs&subject=I%20have%20an%20idea%20for%20/r/nsfw_gifs)**

##Rules

###1. Shirtpost = Meme

Memes should have the word **Shirtpost** in the title. Since they can reference any episode **we do not police Shirtpost comments for spoilers.**

Memes that are very low-effort or barely relevant to the show may be removed.

###2. No spoilers in titles.

For all other posts just put the **season number** in the title so readers know what to expect. Bonus points for including the episode as well.

Use this format: **S#E#**

**Do not put spoilers in titles.** The main page should be safe for everyone to read, even if they’ve only seen the pilot.

###3. Spoiler tag comments as needed.

If a thread is marked S1 and you want to talk about S3, cover the spoilery bits `>!with a tag!<` >!that will look like this.!<

**Please report any post or comment that violates this spoiler policy.**

##Word of God
Use your discretion when discussing Word of God: what Michael Schur says in the media.

If you think it could be a potential spoiler, play it safe and `>!cover with a spoiler tag!<`

**POSTING GUIDELINES**

**Direct Links** Please link directly to the photo wherever possible, preferably using [imgur](http://www.imgur.com) or any other similar service

**Model IDs** Know the model's name? Please include it somewhere in your submission (it's okay if you don't know the name)

**Self Posts** are allowed and encouraged

**What’s an Asian?** For the sake of this subreddit, if the model has at least 50% East Asian ancestry, they count regardless of how they look. 

**Do models from India or Russia count?** Technically these countries are in Asia but unless they meet the above criteria, no, we’re after East Asians.

**Keep it Juicy!** And most importantly, make sure the model you are posting is juicy enough for this subreddit. Posts of petite women with flat chests or tiny butts will be removed.

-----------------------------------------------------

**BANNABLE OFFENSES** 

* Disrespect of the mods will not be tolerated
* Racist comments will not be tolerated

-----------------------------------------------------

**REPORTS** 

These are generally ignored because 99% of the time people are just wasting our time with false reports, expressions of personal opinion etc. However, if a posts gets more than 3 reports, we will look into it. If you have a real issue with a particular post, please message the mods directly and we'll investigate further.

>**Rules**

###Please follow [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette)
>
* **Any** form of discrimination, bigotry, racism or hostility directed towards other players (or other games) will not be tolerated.

###No discussion of specific exploits, hacks or piracy
>
* Any discussion of hacks, exploits or piracy will be removed and action taken accordingly. This includes where to obtain them, how they work and how to use them.
* Please do not post about a specific user you believe to be exploiting/cheating, this will be taken as a witch-hunt and will be removed.
* Please report any suspected hacking or exploiting activity directly to PUBG [using this link](https://www.pubg.com/support/).

###No Trading, Begging, LFG or Gambling posts
>
* Posts relating to the trading and buying of in-game items or game copies should not be made here and will be removed.
* If you would like to find others to play with, please use our official Subreddit Discord using the link in the next sidebar section.
* No gambling or linking to gambling websites.

###No Low Effort posts, Memes or Unrelated topics
>
* This includes, but is not limited to, simple screenshots of loot, your inventory, or other common PUBG sights, as well as memes and any other contributions that would be considered low effort.
* Posts on the Subreddit should ideally contain content capable of sparking discussion, and should be specifically about the game.

###No direct promotion
>
* No promotion of Twitch, YouTube or any other platform accounts. 
* Please contact us if you want to do a giveaway, we can give you further details on what we allow.

###Megathreads, Common topics, and Duplicate topics
>
* During the week we will have various megathreads covering various topics. Any posts covering these topics outside of the megathreads will be removed. 
* Common topics that are seen multiple times per day will be removed as long as a similar topic has been popularized recently.
* We will also remove topics which duplicate a recent post (such as multiple posts of the same stream highlight or news item).
* Additionally, there are times where an event occurs that sparks a range of lively interest and opinions. If there are already publicised posts on the topic we may remove separate threads which do not contribute new information.

###No game ban appeals
>
* Complaints or appeals relating to specific game bans should be made [directly to PUBG](https://www.pubg.com/support/) or [BattlEye](https://www.battleye.com/support/) and not to the subreddit.
* Subreddit moderators or users cannot help with bans, and posting them here only succeeds in fueling drama, often with little evidence.
* General discussion of PUBG's rules and ban reasons are allowed.

**NEW:** Looking for an Italian-language Ouija? Check out /r/DimmiOuija!

---

For a no-spoiler version of AskOuija, visit https://ns.reddit.com/r/AskOuija! All answer flairs will be hidden.

---

**RULES:**

0) **No shitposting.** This includes posts that start with ""if this gets X upvotes...""

1) Posts must ask a question (or be answerable in some way).

2) All comments must be a single character, with a couple exceptions:

* If you feel that the Ouija has completed its answer, you may comment with ""Goodbye"" to end the thread.

* You may add commentary as long as it's a child comment of a ""goodbye"" (in reply to a ""goodbye"", in reply to a comment that's replying to a ""goodbye"", etc).

3) You may not reply directly to your own letter comment (this includes replying to your own letter with a Goodbye) but you can still reply multiple times in a thread.

4) **You may not help answer your own question.** You can still reply to a Goodbye, but you **cannot** add letters or Goodbyes. You've done your job; let the spirits do theirs.

5) **No bots.** (With the exception of the amazing Ouija Bot.)

*These rules are a work-in-progress and subject to change. Feedback is welcome.*

**The Ouija Bot** [[source]](https://github.com/mattdiamond/ouijabot/blob/master/ouija.js)

The Ouija Bot will flair threads with the Ouija's answer. It will do this for threads that contain a ""goodbye"" that meets the comment score threshold. It runs every hour on the hour (roughly).

**Goodbye threshold:** 10 points

(This is just the default... check the [Ouija Configuration Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOuija/wiki/configuration) for information on how to customize this value for your post.)

**Help! The flair on my post is missing or incorrect! What should I do?**

If you think the Ouija Bot should take another look at your post, report the post (*not* the Goodbye) as ""Missing or Incorrect Flair"". (**Update:** Due to changes in the reporting UI, you may need to select the category ""it breaks /r/AskOuija's rules"" in order to select ""Missing or Incorrect Flair"".) Once you've reported your post, the Ouija Bot will reprocess it the next time it runs.

Remember, you need a Goodbye with at least 10 points to have your thread flaired. If you want to lower this threshold, you can add a `minscore` setting to your post. For more info on this, check out the [Ouija configuration guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOuija/wiki/configuration).

# Welcome to \/r/skiing!

##We are a community for skiers of all skill levels and styles.

###New here? 

#Rules

#####1. Don't be rude or a bully.
#####2. All submissions must be related to skiing.
#####3. No blatant self promotion posts.
#####4. No posts already covered in megathreads.

###New to skiing in general?
####Read our [beginner's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/2ez2pg/faqs_about_gear_and_some_tips_for_beginners/) by professional boot-fitter and ski tech /u/Maladjusted_vagabond

**Ski Boot questions?** See a [bootfitter](http://www.bootfitters.com/find-a-fitter). Seriously, see a bootfitter.  Do not post here asking if a boot is good for you.  A good boot is one that fits.  Even the seemingly all-knowing /u/Maladjusted_vagabond cannot help you find a good boot without looking at your feet and having you try some on.  


**DIN and technical questions?**  Please, ask them on /r/skiing.  However, remember that you are taking advice from people on the internet.  /r/skiing mods do take the time to require proof for all user flairs that involve any expertise and skill; however, with questions that could lead to an injury, getting shop advice is always the wisest choice.

Welcome to /r/furry!  This is a community for fans of anthropomorphic animals.  Here you can share art, news, and participate in discussions about the fandom. 

###Submission Guide  *(Hover for expanded info)*  
* **Credit The Artist!**  
When submitting artwork, include the name of the original artist in the title of your post.
 *  **What if I don't know who that is?**  
     Use a reverse image search.  If that doesn't work, you can ask the subreddit for a source.  
 *  **I am the artist.  Do I need to credit myself?**  
     If you are the artist, either mentioning it in the title or in the comments will suffice.

* **Provide a Source!**  
If using an image hosting site, like imgur, include a link to the original image in the comments.
 * **What if I can't find the source?**  
    Then you should provide a link to the artists gallery or social media account.
 * **I am the artist and this is the only source.**  
    If you are the artist, you don't need to provide any additional sources if you don't want to.

* **Tag NSFW Submissions!**  
Certain content considered questionable or explicit is allowed, but it must include a [Q] or [X] in the **title** of the submission.  This content includes...  

 * **[X]: Non-Sexual nudity**  
    Nudity presented in a non-sexual manner.  Barbie doll style nudity is considered SFW.
 * **[X]: Excessive violence**  
     Dismemberment, visible organs, and lots of blood.  Nosebleeds and small cuts are SFW.  
 * **[Q]: Revealing Clothing**  
    Visible undergarments and erotic/teasing clothing.  Most swimwear is considered SFW.
 * **[Q]: Suggestive Poses**  
    Shots that attempt to draw focus to the breasts or butt of a character.


###Subreddit Rules  *(Hover for expanded info)*

1. **Follow the Submission Guide!**  
These are the rules to follow when creating any kind of submission on the subreddit.  

2. **Stay on Topic!**  
Keep posts related to furries, the furry fandom, the \/r/furry community, or \/r/furry subscribers.  
 * **What is an on topic post?**  
    On topic posts relate to furries in some way.  Such as questions to the community, news about conventions, or art of furry characters.  
 * **What is an off topic post?**  
    Off topic posts have no relation to furries.  Such as a picture of a guitar or a video of a game with no anthropomorphic characters.

3. **No Pornography!**    
    Do not post pornography, yiff, or extreme fetish art. This includes vore, snuff, scat, and cub.
 * **What's considered pornography?**  
    Explicit or implied penetrative sex, masturbation, sexual depictions of bodily fluids, and any image made with the intent of sexual arousal.

3. **Don't Spam!**  
keep OC art posts to three (3) max per few hours and non-OC posts to one (1) max every 24 hours.
 * **Why can't I post all of my work?**  
    This is to ensure that the subreddit isn't flooded by a single persons work and to give everyone a chance to have their art be seen.

4. **No Personal Attacks!**  
No personal attacks, aggressive name calling, stalking, harassment, doxxing, or witch-hunts.

5. **Don't Steal!**  
Don't claim or sell any work as your own that is not your original art, have no rights to, or have traced.

6. **No Chatroom Spam!**  
 If you want to share a link to your chatroom, place it into the dedicated chatroom list.  

 **Have questions about the rules? See our more [detailed rules guide](/r/furry/wiki/rules) or [ask the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffurry&subject=Rule Clarification).**

* Include the person who said the quote in the title.  
* Include the resolution **in [brackets]** in the title.
* Include the full quote on the image.

* Original source **is allowed and preferred** over the approved hosts. Please designate your original source with the tag **[OS]** in order to prevent mixups.

3fq53,t5_3fq53,boottoobig,"#####What's BootTooBig?

This is a place to share posts where the title sets up a joke as the first half of a poem and an image delivers the punchline as the second half.

#####Rules
***Posts that do not follow these rules may be removed. All images must be at least 250x250px.***

1. **Mark NSFW posts.** Any post with sexual language or imagery, nudity, or gore, or excessive lewdness must be marked NSFW.
2. **Use the BootTooBig format.** Put plaintext in the title or body as a setup for a screenshot or picture of text as a punchline. The title must rhyme with the text in the body. Wednesdays are ""No Rose Wednesday,"" when posts must start with something other than ""Roses are.""
3. **Use good [rhyme](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/bootsize#wiki_rhyme ""bootsize-meter wiki | /r/boottoobig"") and [meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/bootsize#wiki_meter ""bootsize-rhyme wiki | /r/boottoobig"").** We strictly require good rhyme and meter during the week, but relax the rules for Small Boot Sunday (Saturday 18:00 - Monday 6:00 UTC).
4. **Be civil.** No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry, slurs, or overly edgy jokes (including kill yourself and similar memes). Be kind to each other.
5. **No politics or inflammatory content.** This is a fun sub, so political arguments, agenda pushing, and posts made only to upset others are not permitted. Posts may mention political figures and other celebrities as long as they are politically neutral.
6. **Add the punchline as a comment on implied posts.** If the punchline is implied with an image only, you must include the written punchline as a top level comment.
7. **Avoid reposts.** Avoid posts similar to any that were recently posted, among the top of all time, or that have been [done to death.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/donetodeath ""done to death wiki | /r/boottoobig"")
8. **Follow the [Reddit Content Policy.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy ""Content Policy | redditinc"")** No spam, upvote manipulation, (including ""mods are asleep,"" ""upvote if,"" ""subscribe to"" or anything similar), brigading, or anything else that violates the [sitewide content policy.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy ""Content Policy | redditinc"") Violating this rule will get you banned from here, and **could get you [suspended](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686-Suspensions) from Reddit as a whole.**

##Submission Guidelines

###What makes a Neckbeard Nest? 

A neckbeard nest must meet at least one of the following criteria

* Extremely unsanitary conditions
 * [Example](http://i.imgur.com/30tev.jpg)
 * This isn't your average dirtiness... This is advanced dirtiness!

* Extreme fandom / worship
 * [Example](http://i.imgur.com/dzdEn.jpg ""Mio will never love you back"")
 * This includes Otakus, Bronies, Gamers, etc
 * Keep in mind that this is *extreme* (see below for guidelines)

* *Unique* setting
 * [Example](http://i.imgur.com/rERv5.jpg)
 * If it's in a place you wouldn't consider a normal living space, it's probably a neckbeard nest 


###The following are not neckbeard nests

* Advanced setups

 * [Example](http://i.imgur.com/oEOom.jpg)
 * A high-tech battlestation may indicate that one spends a lot of time gaming, but it does not constitute a neckbeard nest. 

*  *Advanced* fandom
 * [Example](http://i.imgur.com/Vo7SwyI.jpg)
 * While this person is probably a big fan of video games and anime, their room has not been completely claimed by it. They also appear to have their shit together. 
* Slightly messy rooms  
 * [Example](https://i.redd.it/b57g3qsizifz.jpg)  


______

2qh5i,t5_2qh5i,happy,"Too many depressing things on the main page, so post about what makes you warm and fuzzy inside!

Please avoid posting news stories that have a silver lining as while a happy/amazing thing happened, it came out of a sad/depressing situation.

Additionally, if you would like to share news with us, please be descriptive about it. Self posts are allowed on the basis that it is a truly happy event and put effort into writing it. Short or vague self posts **will be removed** as this dilutes the feed.

General Rules:

* **No vague posts** - Short (fewer than 40 characters) posts or titles will be removed.
* **No meme posts** - Low effort content such as posting memes (even with a positive message) will be removed.
* **No silver lining stories** - Stories that are rooted in a negative situation with a minor positive outcome are not allowed. Stories about conquering your fears/challenges on the other hand are allowed.
* **Be kind and supportive** - Shaming, mocking, and otherwise negative commentary is not allowed and such content will be removed. You can give feedback *and* be supportive at the same time.
* **Shameless self-promotion is not allowed** - If you want to share a site or channel you created message the mods first.
* **Share a story!** - Post about what makes you warm and fuzzy inside, we encourage everyone to share a story about their happiness.

3ljke,t5_3ljke,wokekids,"Rule 0: Don't be an asshole. This should go without saying.

Rule 1:  Did someones child say something UNBELIEVABLE!  Are they so profound that they are already more intelligent than 50% of the wing nuts out there? **POST THAT SHIT HERE**

Rule 2: Do not divulge any private details that can reveal the identity of the poster. If a person decides to make their post public to the whole world then that is their problem

Rule 3: Post crazy shit from both sides of the aisle. Did someone's kid who can barely recite the alphabet assert that Trump's policy is going to harm America? Post it. Another kid make a profound speech about the second amendment before his second birthday? Post it.  

Rule 5: It's children. Be sensible. All submissions should be unintentionally hilarious and somewhat wholesome. 

Rule 6:  If you ever come across a post where a child might be being abused physically/emotionally/psychologically, it's important to notify the relevant authority in that child's jurisdiction.

Rule 7: Make sure the posts are actually about *kids*. There's no exact cutoff age, but somewhere between 10 to 12 years old is a good guideline to follow. Older teens can have actually their own (perhaps ill-) thought out opinions on complex issues that would kinda invalidate the whole idea of woke kids.

Rule 8: Satireday: only post satire on Saturdays and flair it appropriately. Don't worry, we'll cut you some slack on Fridays and Sundays because of time zones.

Rule 9: Don't repost anything that's one the top 50 posts of all time or that was posted in the last week. It's better to have a slower stream of new content than to have the same posts over and over again.

2qhva,t5_2qhva,hacking,"A subreddit dedicated to hacking and hacking culture.

What we are about: quality and constructive discussion about the culture, profession and love of hacking.


This sub is aimed at those with an understanding of hacking - please visit /r/HowToHack for posting beginner links and tutorials; any beginner questions should be directed there as they will result in a ban here.

Guides and tutorials are welcome here as long as they are suitably complex and most importantly **legal**!
   
Bans are handed out at moderator discretion.


###Rules:
1. **Keep it legal**
Hacking can be a grey area but keep it above board. Discussion around the legality of issues is ok, encouraging or aiding illegal activities is not

1. We are not your personal army. This is not the place to try to find hackers to do your dirty work and you will be banned for trying. This includes: 
    * Asking someone to hack for you
    * Trying to hire hackers
    * Asking for help with your DoS
    * Asking how to get into your ""girlfriend's"" instagram
    * Offering to do these things will also result in a ban

1. No ""how do i start hacking?"" posts. See /r/howtohack or the stickied post.
Intermediate questions are welcomed - e.g. ""How does HSTS prevent SSL stripping?"" is a good question. ""How do I hack wifi with Kali?"" is bad.
  
1. No ""I got hacked"" posts unless it's an interesting post-mortem of a unique attack. Your nan being phished doesn't count.
 
1. Sharing of personal data is forbidden - no doxxing or IP dumping    
 
1. Spam is strictly forbidden and will result in a ban. Professional promotion e.g. from security firms/pen testing companies is allowed within the confines of site-wide rules on self promotion [found here]  
(https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion), but will otherwise be considered spam.
 
1. Off-topic posts will be treated as spam.     

1. Low-effort content will be removed at moderator discretion

1. We are not tech support, these posts should be kept on /r/techsupport
 
1. Don't be a dick. Play nice, support each other and encourage learning.

*/r/Gay is an 80,000+ strong community of 10 years based on pride and support.*

1) Mark your NSFW posts. Some posts are necessarily NSFW, and they should be marked accordingly. If a post is not marked NSFW and it contains NSFW material it will be removed - if the post was maliciously not-marked, it will result in a ban.

2) /r/Gay is a safe space - no abusive language.  Repeat offenders will be permanently banned. /r/Gay is a safe space - no homophobia or any kind of bigotry.

3) No personal information of any kind. 

4) No selfies.

5) No gratuitous eye candy.

6) No political endorsement. Discussions about politics are ok, but will be heavily monitored by moderators. If any, and we mean any abusive language, harassment, or some other type of material is thrown around that violates the rules or reddiquette, the post will be locked or removed entirely.

7) No spam / blog spam. Do not link your blog/friend's blog, YouTube, etc. unless you have contributed to discussion. Follow Reddit's 10% rule.

p3r73,t5_p3r73,WitchesVsPatriarchy,"**r/WitchesVsPatriarchy** is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. 

The goal is to at once embrace, and poke fun at, the mystical aspects of femininity that have been previously demonized and/or devalued by the Patriarchy.

Taking a more historic approach to the concept of Witches, we channel the spirit of the women who were persecuted in the Salem Witch trials as part of a thinly veiled systemic oppression of female power. 

Witchy Memes are highly encouraged, as well as pop culture references, life advice, and general discussions from a mystical and/or spiritual perspective. Open minds and a sense of humor are required. 

* [ **Join Our Official Book Club!** ](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/765408-witches-vs-patriarchy)

* [**Book Club Bookshelf**](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/765408-witches-vs-patriarchy)

[](/sidebar)

#Rules/Guidelines:
for the nuances of these rules, please read the [expanded ruleset](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules)

###Remember - all judgment is left at moderator discretion.

* Do not post, link to, or ask for personal information
* No trolling, hate speech, or using slurs
* Do not insult other users, flamewar, or flame bait
* Do not /u/ summon users from linked threads
* Do not vote or comment in linked threads 
* Novelty accounts are not welcome in /r/SubredditDrama
* Off-topic grandstanding will be removed
* No post history stalking
* We enforce the spirit of the rules, not the letter
* New accounts get no leeway and will be banned without warning for violating any of our rules

###When in doubt about a rule, please read the rules wiki, or message us for clarification.

Users who break rules may receive a warning via PM or a distinguished comment. You may be warned for rule offenses instead of banned, but certain offenses are ban-on-sight, and **all bans are up to the mod's discretion.**

#Linking

The golden rule of submitting drama is: **Don't bore us.**

If a post doesn't fit these rules, if it's entertaining as fuck submit it anyway and we'll look at it to make an exception. If you're not sure, you can always contact us via modmail.


* **Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in.** Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.
* **SRD is not a call-out subreddit.** If your post points out bad behavior more than it does drama, it will be removed. 
* **Do not make us hunt for the drama.** When submitting drama do not link to the full comments, to images, or otherwise to outside of a comment thread. Links to full threads are allowed where the drama is obvious, but use common sense and direct links when applicable. Use ?context when appropriate. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting_self_posts_and_write-ups) for more information.

#Surplus Popcorn

This is the current list of drama that has a higher bar for submission.

* Partisan pissmatch
* Gun drama
* Gender wars
* Racism drama
* Social Justice drama

If you're going to submit drama for these topics, make sure it's quality! See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_surplus_popcorn) for more information.

Cross-posting is also allowed, but it cannot be done for the purpose of flooding another subreddit with pro-gun comments and votes.   

2.  Discussion, debate, and even heated arguments are allowed and even encouraged as long as they stay on topic, remain somewhat civil and the posters avoid personal attacks.  

3. Follow all general Reddit rules (i.e. DO NOT post personal information of any user.)  

**Policies:**  

1. The moderators will never remove a comment unless it is off-topic spam or doxxing.

>**5. Mark Posts NSFW as necessary:** This is not a NSFW subreddit, so think real hard before posting anything NSFG (Not Safe For Ghusl). Most, if not all, get removed.

>**6. No Shia/Sunni/other hate:** There's a difference between satire and insults and some jokes placed find themselves entering a realm of hate for certain beliefs in Islam. Whether you're Muslim or not, this sub is not meant to be antagonistic to Muslims, so any posts or comments that seem to attack Muslims will be removed and put the user at the risk of a ban. This includes beliefs that you don't agree with. 

>**7. No Blasphemy** In efforts to remain a halal form of humor, we are not allowing blasphemy on this sub. No posts should have some facetious remarks regarding God (SWT), His Prophets (may peace and blessing be upon them), His religion, or anything that would be anti-Islam.

>**8. Translate everything you post:** If you post something in Arabic, or any language, always translate it to English. We have a number of members of this sub that would enjoy your content, but simply don't understand it. Not following this rule makes your post subject to removal.


>**9. No Debating!** This is hardly the place for a real debate about Islamic ideology. Too many people are trolling for you to get any accurate information from most posters here. We recommend heading to /r/islam or /r/Shia if you have questions pertaining to actual Islam.

>**10. No Brigading:** This should be obvious. Don't target any subs and downvote or otherwise attack them for whatever reason.

**What we appreciate:**

* Anti-jokes (they tend to start like regular jokes but lack a punchline).

* Original content or trying to provide a source.

* Good behavior and following [reddiquette] (http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

**What we don't appreciate:**

* Regular jokes (punchlines, puns, etc).

* Reposted anti-jokes (take a look at what's already been posted).

* Bad behavior and spam.

**What is an anti-joke?**

From Wikipedia: *Anti-humor is a type of indirect humor that involves the joke-teller delivering something which is deliberately not funny, or lacking in intrinsic meaning. The audience is expecting something humorous, and when this does not happen, the irony itself is of comedic value.*

**Help with posting:**

* When writing a poem, end each line with two spaces to go onto a new line or leave a blank line to start a new paragraph
* It's okay to x-post your own poem from another subreddit
* Reposts are okay, if you see one you don't like then just downvote it and move on
* Posts where the photo and poem are both in an image tend to do better than text posts with a link to an image
* If you turn someone else's poem into an image, it would be good if you linked the original in the comments
* Try not to put the punchline in the title
* If your poem is sad or is about an animal who passed away then please put [Sad] or [RIP] in the title

**The key features of an ilikthebred poem are:**

* Stanzas of four lines
* Each line has four syllables (or each pair of lines adds up to eight syllables)
* The second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyme
* The stress should fall on the second and fourth syllables of each line (iambic dimeter)
* Tend to have mainly monosyllabic words

An ilikthebred can still be good without these though. :)

**If you're looking for inspiration, try:**

* /r/rarepuppers  
* /r/aww  
* /r/CatsISUOTTATFO  
* /r/meow_irl

2sgzs,t5_2sgzs,Cinemagraphs,"# welcome

## **No posting of regular gifs!**

This is a place for people to post Cinemagraphs. It can be Cinemagraphs that you've found, Cinemagraphs that you've made from movies, or Cinemagraphs that you've made from videos you shot yourself!

## what is a cinemagraph?

> **Any single frame of a Cinemagraph should make for a good photograph**. Is movement the subject of the image? If so, it's probably not a cinemagraph. In a cinemagraph, movement should enhance an image that is already great without it. 

> A cinemagraph is a **high quality gif or video that is very smoothly looped**. It's more than a well looped gif, though; it should be beautiful as a great photograph, evocative like a movie, and more alive than either. A great cinemagraph is wonderful art! Read our [in-depth definition of cinemagraphs](/r/Cinemagraphs/wiki/definition), but here's the tl;dr:

> * **non-moving frame of reference**, like a photograph (the camera doesn't move)

> * smoothly looped, and **good resolution**

> * should have some movement which either **captures the entire essence of a scene, or isolates a movement within a larger scene**

##how do I do this?

> Try out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DU0Sim_BJ4&index=3&list=FLeQ2k5Fm3gR2922N4OzlMVQ) which is pretty easy to get into as long as you have Adobe CS6 or CC.

## desktop background?

> /r/dreamscene 

> /r/LivingBackgrounds 

# guidelines

## cite what you submit

We would like you to do your best to **name the person that created the cinemagraph**. Naming the movie source is nice to do, but is not required. When you do not know the creator, give it the flair that states you don't know the source. Failure to cite or to acknowledge that you can't cite your posts will likely end in the removal of your submission. You should definitely check to see if it's on [this page](/r/Cinemagraphs/top/?sort=top&t=all); submissions from the top **will be removed if they are not cited properly**. Also, please don't post the freaking owl.

## don't whine about reposts

Please don't complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. (from [the reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).

## ""this isn't a Cinemagraph"" <-- no

These kinds of comments are subject to immediate removal if you cannot provide a valid criticism of the post. Write us a paragraph explaining your opinion. See below about providing generous criticism; if you explain why something might not fit your definition of a Cinemagraph, you might give the artist (or person who found it) some ideas for improvement.

## tag your posts and yourself

You're encouraged to add link flair to your post. There are a few to choose from (see the link flair section below). You're also encouraged to add an [OC] tag to things that you make. **If you fail to add link flair or an [OC] tag, your submission may get removed!** Send /u/aphoenix a PM to get userflair. [More info about flair](/r/Cinemagraphs/wiki/flair)

## be generous with praise and criticism

> Above all, be honest and forthcoming  

> Be specific, don't just say ""I like it!"" say, ""I like the way you...."" and likewise for negative comments  

> Be helpful, link to books, tutorials, or offer exercises for the artist  

> Don't refer to things as ""good"" or ""bad,"" try to talk in terms of skill sets that can be worked on  

> When receiving a critique, don't be too defensive; you can't explain away other peoples opinions of your art so try to listen to what they are saying  

> Read this [great post by Huisme](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtCrit/comments/18dq8a/having_some_issues_with_this_subreddit_for_a/c8e1jf7) on asking for critique

# **guide to a good hmm**

**hmms** are images that make you think about the context, do a double take, invoke a deeper meaning, or just leave you thinking about how or why they exist:

*   [bizarre **hmm**](http://i.imgur.com/WORLtGl.jpg)

*   [humour **hmm**](http://i.imgur.com/P5PLlvA.jpg)

*   [art **hmm**](http://i.imgur.com/yC3wYU6.jpg) (nsfw)

*   [arresting **hmm**](http://i.imgur.com/YBjvAXG.jpg)

*   [confusing **hmm**](http://i.imgur.com/1Ehes5v.jpg)

As long as they give you a good solid [**hmm...**](http://i.imgur.com/Zv8OoCi.jpg) why would that bear be in a cubicle...

If you're not sure if it's **hmm**, have a browse of the top content. Photoshops and art are welcome.

**Quality guide:**

*   Try and use hq images
*   You can [reverse image search](https://images.google.com/) to find better quality versions
*   Crop out parts of the image that don't contribute anything
*   Avoid pics that are [trying too hard](http://i.imgur.com/uxd88KA.jpg)
*   Posts may be removed if they're not hmm enough

2v5ru,t5_2v5ru,LinusTechTips,"##Welcome!

Welcome to /r/LTT, a subreddit dedicated to LinusTechTips, where you can submit and discuss the latest LinusMediaGroup videos.

If you have any suggestions for the sub, drop me a mod mail and I'll get back to you!

##Notice

We may curate content to remove low effort posts. This is done at the moderators discretion but typically includes low quality memes, jokes and reposts.

##Rules

1) We'd greatly appreciate it if we could keep all content related to the Linus Media Group. Please refrain from making posts about general technology questions (and PC build advice), we have subreddits on the sidebar that would be more suited to these posts. Feel free to post technology questions if it's relevant to a video. 

2) Follow [Rediquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and never display any personal information in your posts

3) If, in rare cases, your content is NSFW, tag it as such

4) Don't be a dick, troll, or post low effort 'bait' comments to get a reaction and cause disruption

5) Requests to build/find a PC for you are no longer allowed, please post these requests to a subreddit such as [/r/buildapcforme](http://reddit.com/r/buildapcforme)

6) We love original content, but please keep it relevant to Linus

7) NO politics 

Also, for those who post video suggestions, whilst appreciated, there's no guarantee they'll be read by a member of the LMG team. 

Our mod team comprises of two fans (/u/Frosstic & /u/ImFrazle), and four members of the Linus Media Group (/u/Caltane, /u/NickLTT, /u/AnthonyLTT & /u/LMG_Aprime).

Thank you!

**Posting Rules**

1: **Read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq) before posting.** 

2: **Stay on topic.** The following are examples of posts that are not on topic: cheat posts, “farewell” posts, posts about other diets that are not keto, rants about other people that aren’t following a keto diet, etc. Off topic discussions will only be allowed in the Daily Community Support thread.

>2.a: Why no cheat posts? In addition to being off-topic, cheat posts are specifically against the rules of this subreddit because they are negative, defeatist, and can serve as a trigger to those who are struggling.

3: **Be respectful.** Personal attacks, threats, and inappropriate/sexual comments will not be allowed. Please see the Community Guidelines for a more detailed explanation of what types of comments are in violation of this rule.

4: **No low effort posts.** Low effort posts are: title-only posts, posts with under 200 characters including those that contain only links to articles or images/memes, and posts asking questions that are explicitly answered in the FAQ. Save your memes for r/ketocirclejerk

5: **No self-promotion.** This includes posts linking to or containing: personal blogs/channels/websites/social media pages, affiliate/referral links, or surveys for market research or educational purposes. If you are posting progress pictures with a watermark we ask that the watermark contain your Reddit username only.

6: **Do not ask r/keto for medical advice.** Reddit is not a replacement for your doctor. Do not solicit or offer medical advice on this subreddit.

5. Please link directly to the gif - no websites or videos. For blogs, reupload the gifs to imgur and leave a link to the blog in the comments. HTML5 files are allowed.

Posting Rule :

Normal Reddit rules apply, nudity post need NSFW tag, lightly gore or non-explicit death should be tagged NSFW and state ""[NSFW]"" (or ""[NSFL]"" if people died) in the title. Excessively gore, brutal or disturbing content (ie. people clearly dying on video) is NOT allowed and will be removed.

Random stuff that do not fit the subreddit theme will be removed at the mods discretion. also feel free to report posts that you think do not fit here or violate the rules.

^((Just to clarify: Content does not need to be from GTA or Russia, it can be from elsewhere and will be tolerated/accepted as long as it follows the general archetype of the subreddit (i.e. : it could have been Russia or GTA)^) ^(if you are not sure if it fit, check the top rated posts on the subreddit or message the moderation team directly)^)

Welcome to Tales from the Front Desk, a sub where Desk Jockeys and others in the hospitality come to vent/share stories of their battles at the desk. 

DO NOT MESSAGE MODS ABOUT GETTING YOUR POST APPROVED IF YOU DONT MEET THE KARMA REQUIREMENTS, THAT WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN. READ THE RULES BEFORE POSTING.

**This sub is MOSTLY for stories about hotel experiences, not for questions about hotels, see below for other hotel related subs that may be what you are looking for. Your post will be removed if its not a ""Tale""**

**You must have 100 Karma and an Account older than 30 days to Post/comment here**

***
**If you have a question about hotels you can head over to /r/askhotels for all questions hotel related.**

**RULES**

**Stay anonymous! & Don't be an asshole**

Don't post identifying information - This includes:

Property/franchise name and location

Specific rewards program names - if you're referring to a rewards guest, just say ""top tier rewards guest"" or something similar. 

Users should not try to guess what brand/franchise hotel someone works at.

Change dates/locations of incident if you're worried the offending guest may be a redditor and see your post. 

Personal attacks will not be tolerated and may result in an immediate ban. 

**For all rules: first incident is warning, second incident is a permanent ban.**

Any user found to be posting personal information that could be used to identify (""doxx"") a person will be instantly and permanently banned without warning. This includes but isn't limited to names, email addresses, postal addresses and telephone numbers.
***


**Other Rules**


memes, reaction gifs, and other posts of that nature will be removed. However, [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/28ae5e/working_in_a_shady_motel_in_the_ozarks_how_i_lost/) is a hilarious and appropriate use of reaction gifs that enhance the story.

###Welcome!
A subreddit for lovers of analog photography. Share your film photographs and discuss anything analog!

###Rules - [View in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/about/rules/)

1) Include the film stock and camera used in your post title. If you do not know some of the required information, state that in either the title or top-level comment e.g. [Nikon F3, 50mm f/1.8, Unknown Film], or use [Found Film] for auction/thrift store finds, family photos, and so on. 

2) Maximum of three image posts per day. Post an album to share more at once.

3) All gear/film posts go in the weekly gear thread

4) No trading or selling. If you want to do this, please use dedicated communities such as \/r/photomarket.

5) Flair NSFW posts e.g. nudity, gore, sex

6) Constructive criticism of photos is always welcomed here, but personal attacks, brigading, soap-boxing, disrespectful or marginalising the work or its subject are unacceptable.

7) No photos that are digital in origin. Post-processing work is perfectly fine; however, extensive manipulation should be disclosed in the comments.

8) You must own or have license for images you submit. With image(s) you did not personally take, include the source in the topic title, or a comment if too long for a title.

9) Do not include social media, website, or crowdfunding links in titles or top-level comments. If someone asks for a link then you can respond to that. Please submit promo links to the Self Promotion thread.

10) Flair your posts when possible e.g. “Critique Wanted” when specifically wanting critique, “Help Wanted” for questions, etc.  Personal subreddit flair can be used for instagram handles, flickr links, etc.

|||
:-|:-
**1. [BE NICE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/4lppzy/a_trend_i_notice_here_we_need_to_stop_being_dicks/)**|We're all humans with real human feelings. (Most of us.)
**2. No spam, selling, advertisements, or social media.**|This includes selling equipment, fish, or linking to YouTube channels, seller pages, blog posts, Facebook, Instagram, etc. When it comes to posting on this subreddit, we limit this to two posts per day. If you want to post multiple images, please use an album. 
**3. No posts or comments praising or advertising betta fighting.**|Seriously, do we need to tell you why?
**4. Please include water parameters and tank info in your help posts.**|If you have a question or problem, please add a CLEAR picture and some details (tanksize, equipment, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels etc.).  *""Everything is fine""* is not a tank parameter!
**5. Don't post discussions or pics to complain/hate/shit on bad betta tanks/products/care.**|This includes bad care in fish stores, bad novelty bowls, someone else's bad betta care. Posts that ask for input on how to deal with someone's bad care are allowed.
**6. Don't post irrelevant stuff, ok?**|If it doesn't involve a betta fish, it doesn't belong.  
**7. All posts but memes must be original content.**| So no artwork/photos from other artists (known or unknown), or breeder pictures (except when used in a side-by-side comparison of the advertised betta to the one you actually received). Repost those memes, though, you know you want to.

**FORUM RULE:  NO LOCATION SPECIFICS IN COMMENTS, ONLY BY PM.**

Feel free to share specific locations (e.g. entry points, names of sensitive places) by PM, but not in posts or comments.  Of course this does not apply to what's on outside links.  

This rule is not out of bloody-minded elitism, but to prevent destructive hosers from finding places too easily and trashing them.  Remember that reddit is indexed by search engines.

And please, please, don't steal. It's not cool and you make us look bad.

Please avoid posting ""Anyone know any places to explore in ___?"" You would be much better off asking if anyone wants to explore in said area and use google and other resources (uer.ca) to find them.

#### Rules

1. **No harassment, hate speech, anti-kancolle cj.** Regardless of their server choice, ship choice, spending habits, or use of free time, respect your fellow players. Yes, there's ships in the game that represent the Kriegsmarine. That doesn't mean you need to recite Nazi salutes. Also, no need for generic kancolle circlejerking that's been posted many, many times before.
2. **Use the Megathreads.** Questions should be posted in the Questions Megathread. Gacha and Drop related content should be posted in the Gacha & Drop Megathread. Dorm layout related content should be posted in the Dorm Showcase Megathread. Do not make new threads for these types of content.
3. **Art posts: Titles must include ship names, Sources must be linked.** If the art features multiple ships, name the three most prominent. INCLUDE SOURCES (mark OC if it's your own art) Cosplay is art.
4. **NSFW art belongs on the Azur Lewd subreddit.** While less offensive work is permitted, always mark as NSFW if you are unsure.
5. **No advertising.** This includes posts showcasing dakimuras disguised as Art posts.
6. **No account buying/selling.** Instant ban.
7. **Flair your posts properly.** Art posts must use the Art flair. Posts that contain memes must use the Meme flair. If posting Azur Lane news related to a specific region, use the appropriate flair (Japan, China, Korea, English).
8. **All content must be related to Azur Lane.** It sounds obvious but it needs to be said. All posts should be related to Azur Lane. If your post is deemed not related enough, then it will be removed.
9. **No Reposts or Extremely Low-Effort Content.** No low-effort posts, such as Ark Royal loli memes, pictures of defense fleets, numbah wan spam, etc. (At least try to put some effort into it...) 
*This includes posting more than one piece of art per 24 hours.*

Posts and comments breaking rules will be subject to **removal without notice** (we usually do comment on what you did wrong, though). Repeated offenders will be suspended or banned at moderator discretion.

##**How This Place Works**
* **Upvote:** Unpopular/controversial opinions and well written posts.    
* **Downvote:** Popular/non controversial opinions and/or poorly written posts.
    

##**Rules** 
* **If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.**  

- RULE 1: **Correct Formatting**  
The requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. The text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. You may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion.   

- RULE 2: **Opinion must be unpopular/controversial**   
This sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. If your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. **SO PLEASE SEARCH BEFORE SUBMITTING**.  

- RULE 3: **No Spam**  
New accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. Spamming will usually result to a perma ban.  

- RULE 4: **No Trolling**   
Trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. Trolls will usually get permanently banned.

- RULE 5: **Be Civil**  
Let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. Resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. Keep it civil.

- RULE 6: **Elaborate**   
An important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. There is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said.   
Your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod.

- RULE 7: **Hate posts are not allowed**  
Opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. Hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect. Bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia *activities* (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will *usually* count as hate speech. This does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. **Race baiting is a ban-able offence**  

- RULE 8: **No Low Effort/Satire Posts**   
Any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. This also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. Please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post.

- RULE 9: **No Reposts/Search Before Submitting**   
If essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). It WILL get removed. If your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there.

- Rule 10: **No US Politics**
Please do not post anything directly related to US politics. Topics that are politically charged but not necessarily political (abortion, immigration, economics, etc) are acceptable provided they follow all other rules.
There is an enormous number of places on the internet and on reddit to discuss US politics until you're red (or blue) in the face. You can comment in our weekly politics megathread if you want to discuss politics on the subreddit.

- Rule 11: **No Meta Posts**
A meta post is one that discusses the subreddit itself. Please do not make these posts, whether positive, negative or neutral, as the purpose of the subreddit is not to discuss the subreddit. We do have, from time to time, a stickied megathread for meta posts.

A subreddit for propaganda collectors, enthusiasts, or anyone fascinated by propaganda as an insight into history, sociology, perspective, and manipulation.

Posters, paintings, leaflets, cartoons, videos, music, broadcasts, news articles, or any medium is welcome - be it recent or historical, subtle or blatant, artistic or amateur, horrific or hilarious. 

Guidelines
===

1) Don't vote on whether you agree with the message of a post.

2) Don't post with the intent to spread propaganda you agree with or the intent to degrade propaganda you disagree with.

3) Civil conversation is okay; soapboxing, racism and personal attacks are not.

4) Titles must have a date and must be neutral. If in doubt, you can simply use the caption of the poster (eg. *""I want you!"", US, 1917*).

5) No memes or clickbait. Image macros are only allowed if released by an official agency and the source is provided.

6) No current events. To help us to be objective, posts cannot be from within the last two years. Please post contemporary work on  /r/ModernPropaganda.

#**Kill the Cameraman**
Here you can see videos of interesting/entertaining things but the cameraman is doing such a bad job you want to physically hurt him. Whether it is sideways recordings, cameramen with parkinson, videos with horrible focus or where the cameraman has a zoom fetish, it can all be published and shared here. So we, the *impeccable* cameramen, together may judge the footage.



---
##### **Guidelines for Posting:**

1. Video filmed in an incompetent way, making it hard to pay attention to the content of the video.
2. Video of cameramen being hurt or failing to protect their equipment.
3. The bad footage must be a result of bad camerawork, not bad editing or a live performance where bad camera angles are shown.
4. If the cameraman is acting like an asshole and therefore should be killed, guidelines 1, 2 and 3 can be overlooked.
5. If the video is NSFW make sure to tag it as such.
6. No footage from cameras without a cameraman. This includes security cameras, dash cams, mounted gopros and footage from other mounted cameras that is not under the control of a cameraman.
7. Memes are allowed, but they have to be dank or else they get removed.

2qmiy,t5_2qmiy,audiophile,"• **audio·phile**: *a person with love for, affinity towards or obsession with high-quality playback  of sound and music.*

r/audiophile is a forum for discussion of the pursuit of quality audio reproduction of all forms, budgets, and sizes. Our primary goal is insightful discussion of equipment, sources, music, and audio concepts.

## Rules

1. **Be most excellent towards your fellow redditors.** And by ""be most excellent"" we mean no personal attacks, threats, bullying, trolling, baiting, flaming, hate speech, racism, sexism, or other behavior that makes humanity look like scum.
2. **Ask for product opinions and purchase advice in the [sticky purchase help thread](/r/audiophile/about/sticky).** This includes general questions or comparisons about gear and peripherals regardless of intent to purchase.
3. **Post questions about tech support and general help in the [sticky tech support/general help thread](/r/audiophile/about/sticky?num=2).** Low effort questions also go here.
4. **Image posts must be accompanied by impressions or a review that adds value to the post.** The impressions or review do not need to be exhaustive, but they should strive to explain how you feel about the product(s) and why you feel that way. No pictures of unopened boxes!
5. **We do not allow**: affiliate links, links to affiliate farms, pirated content, NSFW/NSFL content, market research, surveys, sweepstakes, giveaways, spam or self promotion.
6. **No selling or buying.** Please use /r/AVExchange
7. **No headphones and portable audio related content**. Please use /r/headphones

Additionally, [sitewide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and [reddiquette applies](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).  We may further remove posts that are deemed off-topic, or better suited to other subreddits.

[Read the rules in full here](/r/audiophile/about/rules).


## What we want to see

* Content that facilitates [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ADiscussion&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options) about audio quality
* New hardware [releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ANews&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options)
* Gear [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AReview&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options)
* Reviews of audiophile [music](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AMusic&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options)
* Discussions on [audio technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ATechnology&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options)
* [Photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AEyecandy&feature=legacy_search#res-hide-options) of your setup. Or someone else's if it gives audiophiles ""The fizz""

### Rules

* **Rule 1:**       
**Images must be of real astronomical objects or phenomena only.** Terrestrial man-made objects and people are not to be included in the image. Terrain should be unintrusive and cropped to the best of your ability to avoid excess landscape. Images which violate this rule will be removed at moderator discretion and possibly without warning/explanation. 
* **Rule 2:**       
Posts can only be images that **you** have captured and processed, or discussion about capturing or processing your own images.
* **Rule 3:**       
Links to blogs, articles or external websites should be interesting and promote discussion about astrophotography. Posts of this type that do not encourage discussion will be removed.
* **Rule 4:**       
*Image posts are to link directly to the image, not to landing pages, personal galleries, or professional sites. Submissions that link to professional photography sites, or gallery/feed based services or pages are not allowed.
* **Rule 5:**       
**All submitted images MUST include acquisition AND processing details as a top-level comment**. All posts without this information will be given a warning, and if not corrected will be removed. 
* **Rule 6:**       
Unless you have done a drastic alteration or reprocessing of a prior submission, you may not repost your edit. Adding data, completely reprocessing, or making changes that have a major effect on the image will qualify it to be reposted as an update. A period of one week must pass before you make any repost of a similar image. Additionally, all 'accolade' type posts (publications/etc) should be contained in a self-post.
* **Rule 7:**       
All posts must contain the name of the subject in the image. Equipment details and karma-bait titles are not allowed. Posts with these infractions will be subject to the discretion of a moderator for removal. If you are unsure about your title violating this rule, or if automod removed your post, please  see [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/titles) or message the moderators for more details.
* **Rule 8:**       
Since we are an *amateur* astrophotography subreddit, we'd like all images must be taken with amateur equipment. Therefore, we are no longer allowing images acquired by professional equipment or professional services. Data should be captured using equipment which you own.
* **Posting etiquette:**     
Please follow rediquette to the best of your ability - please keep discussion on topic and treat each other with respect. Keep general questions in the weekly sticky. Try to keep memes and politics off the sub.    
**This subreddit encourages and welcomes constructive criticism of images. If you think an OP can improve in any way please don't be shy and speak up!**

**RULES:**
=

######**We are NOT /r/CrappyDesign!**  
  
* **RULE 1: *True DDOI* images must follow the format of [DDOI](http://i.imgur.com/Ipg62jA.jpg).**  
Signs must be read correctly top to bottom, and incorrectly left to right, like any text usually.  
DONT | DEAD  
OPEN | INSIDE  
However easily you can read it has no bearing on whether or not it belongs here.
We also allow for non-true DDOI here: Take a look [**at our wiki page about post types**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/wiki/post_types) to see if your type of post is allowed here!

* **RULE 2: No reposts!**  
No reposts from the last 4 months or the top 25 of all time.

* **RULE 3: No overposted content!**  
That means nothing from [**this list.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/wiki/overposted)

* **RULE 4: Don't force it!**  
Don't post anything that is forced or easily staged/faked. Examples include:
 * socks, pillows or shirts with text (next to each other)
 * paneled scenes or comics
 * Pages of articles, books, magazines, etc.
 * Spines of books or movies

* **RULE 5: Be civil!**  
Just be nice. Don't insult people. Also no racism, sexism and similar. Violating this rule may get you banned.

* **RULE X: Put the DDOI in the title!**  
That's (currently) not a hard rule, but it's encouraged to put the ""correctly read"" way in the title, like ""DONT DEAD OPEN INSIDE"". We *may* remove posts that don't follow this format and have an exceptionally bad title.

* **RULE Y: Censor private info and mark NSFW!**  
Pretty self-explaining: Mark things NSFW if necessary and censor private info like names, phone numbers and similar if applicable.

**What is a Hotwife?**

A Hotwife is a person who is allowed to engage in sexual encounters with others with the PERMISSION of their spouse/significant other. There is no cheating involved here because the spouse/significant other is fully aware of the actions that are being performed and are approved/encouraged.

5. All content must be related to the Hotwife lifestyle.

6. No image macros (memes), karma whoring posts (upvote for more pictures) or any other unrelated content.

7. No ""message me for more"" content posts. This includes posting for the sole purpose of using another chat platform. 

8. Keep your comments civil.


**Approved Content:**

1. Images and Videos of your Hotwife having sexual relations with another person. **Content should be user generated.**
2. Text posts that tell a story about your Hotwife having an encounter with another person.

***Check the first box - https://i.imgur.com/PjSP6hf.png***

***And then uncheck this one if you are still having troubles https://i.imgur.com/YnUvV9I.png***

**User made content is not only appreciated but also very much encouraged!**

### **Posting Guidelines**

Straying away from posting guidelines ***might*** lead to ban.

1. **Please behave. Overly sexual, or rude comments towards posters will be deleted.** 

2. **Pictures do not have to be specifically Ahegao (As in perfect Ahegao) as long as they follow the spirit of it.**

3. **Tongue should always be out and eyes always visible.**

4. **Ahegao should be the focus of the picture, gif or the video.**

5. **It is okay to link to an album with mostly non Ahegao content. As long as the first picture is. And the album follows a theme. Either the same girl, or occasionally the same cosplay.**

6. **Please use Imgur and Gfycat.**

7. **Only pictures of real people.**
 
8. **Please try to avoid reposting.**
 
9. **Please make sure subjects of the picture or video are 18+**


### **What is Ahegao?**
* **Ahegao has its roots in Anime/Hentai. It is usually an extreme orgasmic facial expression, that most of the time includes tongue pulled out, eyes rolled all the way up and a mindless/blank/blissful expression.** 


* **Here in/r/RealAhegao we don't always go to extremes though. As such, a lighter form of the ""look"" is fully acceptable! Just have fun!**

### **Verification**
* **Verification is not required to post! It is only needed if you wish to apply for a contest!**

* **If you wish to be verified, there are two simple Steps!**


* **Make two different pictures of yourself holding a piece of paper, with your username and current date written on it.** 


* **Either post them in the subreddit, in which case make sure they include ahegao and ""Verification"" tag. Or, send them to moderators by DM or Moderator Mail**

2xca1,t5_2xca1,UmbrellaAcademy,"The Umbrella Academy, coming to Netflix in 2019, is an adaptation of the Dark Horse comics about a dysfunctional family of superheroes — The Monocle, Spaceboy, The Kraken, The Rumor, The Séance, Number Five, The Horror, and The White Violin — who work together to solve their father’s mysterious death. This subreddit is for discussions, pictures, drawings, cosplays, news and anything else to do with the Umbrella Academy.

**Community Rules**

1: Spoilers MUST be tagged in comments or posts. This subreddit focuses on creating a welcoming community for first time fans of the new Netflix series or the comics, and so we are going to do our best to keep spoiler like information from both mediums tagged for those who want to avoid them. 

* For a detailed spoiler policy, [see our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/UmbrellaAcademy/wiki/spoilerpolicy). We strongly recommend all users take a minute to review our spoiler policy


2: Be Civil and Respectful. Following [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is encouraged. Following the [Rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) is required. 

* Remember the human you are talking with behind the screen. Keep things civil
* Disagreements about the show are fine, but don't attack or needlessly degrade others. 
* Assume others are engaging in good faith unless you have reason to believe otherwise.
* Treat sensitive topics with care and respect. 
* While the show and comics touch on a number of social-political issues, full on debates about current politics should move to more appropriate subreddits


3: Avoid duplicate links. Sometimes differing articles on the same subject have additional information, so feel free to share a different story if you think it is relevant, however if a link has already been shared on the sub please don't repost it unless sufficient time has passed since the first posting.  

4: NSFW submissions and comments must be labeled as such. If you would be uncomfortable showing it to your boss, child, or grandparent use the NSFW tag. Sexual depictions of minor children are against reddit policy. Keep any risque fanart to the adult versions of the academy. No one cares that Number 5 is an adult in a childs body, keep all fanart of 5 rated PG. 

5: Self Promotion. Sharing OC is strongly encouraged, and with OC often comes self-promotion. We are all fans of the Academy, and we love to celebrate our content creators on this sub. We ask that you take care to participate in the community beyond self-promotion though. Users who actively engage themselves in the subreddit and make the occasional self-promotional post will be approved. However, treating our subreddit solely as a platform for advertisement is not allowed.

#[Submit text post](http://www.reddit.com/r/warthunder/submit?selftext=true)

#Please activate this subreddit's custom style 

#for access to extra functionality such as content filters

1. **Read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/warthunder/wiki/faq).**

2. **Flair your post appropriately after submitting.** Unflaired posts don't get an upvote button and incorrectly flaired posts may be removed.
 - Do not abuse the NEWS flair. It is intended *only* for official War Thunder news from Gaijin sites and sources.
 - The DATAMINE flair is for substantive datamining posts. Please do not overuse it for e.g. individual screenshots or minor discoveries.
 - The MEME flair is intended for memes. It is not a catch-all flair for jokes and satire.

3. **Don't spam /r/WarThunder.** Please strive to post at most once per day for any one kind of post.
 - If submitting multiple videos/gifs/images in a short time period, post them in a single text post with descriptions for each individual item.
 - Submitting low-effort posts of any kind in quick succession will lead to post removals and may lead to a ban.

4. **Use clear titles.** /r/WarThunder aims to make its content clear from a quick glance. 
 - If your submission has an unclear title you should submit a top-level comment explaining the content.
 - Posts with ""clickbait"" titles will be removed.

5. **No unrelated submissions.** All content should be clearly relevant to the game of War Thunder and its vehicles.
 - Memes must be clearly visually relevant to War Thunder. This means just having a witty related caption or title is not enough. Be creative and use game assets to tie it into War Thunder.
 - Posts of military history entirely unrelated to War Thunder should be posted instead to /r/history,  /r/aviation, /r/WWIIplanes, /r/AircraftPorn, /r/TankPorn, etc.
 - Posts made to promote other games will be removed.

6. **""Gaijin Please"" posts**:
 - If for a vehicle suggestion, please first refer to the [updated list of previously suggested vehicles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w2Vnvn-rMRzkqlo8gQYffeUiISRG8ZvWK8Vu89mzXRE/edit?usp=sharing). If your suggestion is there already, don't post it again.
 - [*Must be clearly explained*](https://old.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/9vopay/subreddit_rules_change_announcement_gaijin_please/): make and model must be in the title. There should be a detailed description, background, and capabilities of the vehicle AND/OR a link to an appropriate Info/Wiki page must be in the comments (Alternatively, a self post with all information contained). *Why you want the vehicle in the game, AND where you think it could be placed* must be within the post or your top level comment.
 - Must be flaired with the GAIJIN PLEASE flair.
 - Must be relevant to War Thunder in terms of time frame and purpose.
 - Tag /u/ClockworkRaider in the post.
 - If the post hasn't had a moderator comment within 48 hours, please PM the mod team or tag a member with a comment.

7. **Memes**:
 - Must be *clearly visually relevant* to War Thunder and/or its vehicles, in more than just title/caption (see Rule 5)
 - [May only be posted on meme days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/8144yn/notam_meme_day_restrictions_are_now_in_place_from/). These are: *Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday*. The timezone for cutoff is [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc).
 - Note that memes visible during the non-meme days, but posted during meme days will not be removed.

8. **If posting NSFW material, tag it NSFW.**

9. **No abuse, harassment, racism, hate speech, discrimination, flame-baiting, trolling, pornographic posts nor general assholery.** Don't encourage witch hunts against anyone. Be excellent to each other.

10. **No posts related to breaking the rules set out by Gaijin.** Selling/advertising the sale of accounts, codes, gold generating apps, cheating bots, etc. will lead to an instant ban.

11. **For any suggestions or questions related to the subreddit, [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FWarthunder).** PMs to individual mods may be ignored. Please note our modteam is not affiliated with Gaijin Entertainment and War Thunder - go to [the official forums](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php) for game/account issues.

###This is a place where people in the world of pharmacy can tell their story, vent about what occurred, and read some humor about others.

---

##Rules:

**1)** **NO** violations of [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/) - anyone doing this will be banned without warning

**2)** Are you a patient or someone else who wants to voice their complaint about your local pharmacy? This is not the correct place for it. Please direct those posts to /r/TalesFromTheCustomer.  

**3)** If you have a specific question then those are more suited for /r/Pharmacy than here.  If posting there then get straight to the question without too much unneeded information.  Any posts containing either of these will be removed.

**4)** Images are okay but an accompanying story must appear      in the comments

**5)** Anything read here should not be taken as any type of medical advice. If you are searching for specific medical advice then Reddit is not the place to look for it.  Please direct yourself to a medical professional such as your local pharmacist, doctor, or provider.  

**6)** Questions regarding Pharmacy Technicians can also be found in /r/PharmacyTechnician

**7)** No memes.  Those can be directed to /r/pharmacymemes

**8)** If it isn't a tale then it doesn't belong here and will be removed

##Our Theme Song Courtesy of /u/KetrinaKetrina
(To the tune of ""Just Keep Swimming"" in ""Finding Nemo"")


Hey mister grumpy pharmacist

When pharmacy life gets you down you know what you got to do ?

Just keep filling, just keep filling, filling, filling, filling

What do we do we? Fill fill fill. 

I LOVE FILLING WHEN YOU WANT TO FILLLLLLLLL YOU KEEP ON 
FILLING !

Smaller projects are okay as long as they're exceptionally clean and interesting, and you include some explanation. A good rule of thumb is it should have at least 20 cables.

#**This sub is for:**

**News, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge the narratives presented by the ruling classes.** Posts need not be about capitalism specifically, whether late-stage or otherwise; we simply aim to cater to a socialist audience.

We do allow links to threads and comments on Reddit, as long as they are relevant to the content guidelines and follow the rules. **Use NP links, or your post will be deleted.**

---

#*Philosophy:*

*This subreddit has its roots in broad-based anti-capitalist thought, with an underlying Marxist tendency that is steeped in intersectionalist Critical Theory.*

*When it comes to proposed alternatives to Capitalism, it is the general consensus of this subreddit that the contradiction between Capital and Labour must be eliminated; the working class should own and control the means of production. We call this socialism.*

---

#*Rules:*

* **Reddit-wide rules apply.** Of course, this rule applies Reddit-wide already by definition, but let this serve as a reminder that behavior such as brigading and harassment won't be permitted.

* **No trolling.** ""I was just trolling"" won't be accepted as a defense for breaking rules, and we will ban for intentionally disruptive behavior or attacks on our sub, users, or ideology.

* **No capitalist apologia or anti-socialism.** This subreddit is intended for a socialist audience, and while questions are allowed, pushing your own counter-narrative here is not. We do not allow support here for capitalism or for the parties or ideologies that uphold it. We are not a liberal or (US) Democrat subreddit; we are a socialist subreddit.
 * Social democracy is liberalism. Socialists want worker control of the means of production; social democrats want a capitalist welfare state.

* **No imperialism or reactionarism.** This includes not just ideologies to the right of liberalism but also right-wing traits such as national/ethnic/cultural chauvinism and military/police worship regardless of the underlying ideology.

* **No bigotry.** No racism, sexism, homomisia, transmisia, ableism, or classism. The comfort level of readers who experience these forms of bigotry takes priority in this subreddit over your right to speak freely.
 * [This subreddit stands against hate speech](http://redd.it/3djkz4).
 * We are not open to ""brocialist"" viewpoints that say these problems don't matter, will be solved by the end of capitalism, or can wait until after the end of capitalism.

* **No sectarianism.** All socialists are to be comrades here, which doesn't mean you have to agree about everything but does mean you need to refrain from insulting people based on their tendency.

* **Bans are at moderator discretion.** We reserve the right to eject users (as well as remove, lock, or otherwise moderate any content on the subreddit) for reasons not listed if we consider it necessary to do so.

* **DO NOT MESSAGE US WITH PROMOTION REQUESTS FOR YOUR OWN STUFF.** While we are a leftist community and support constructive measures to educate, agitate, and organize, we are not anyone's personal advertising platform.

* **Do not post NSFL Content;** it will be removed.

* **This is not a debate subreddit.** If you wish to debate or learn more, visit the links in the sidebar, the material in our wiki, and our [Crash Course on Socialism](https://github.com/sonofevil/essays/blob/master/crash_course_socialism.md), [Glossary of Socialist Terms](https://github.com/sonofevil/essays/blob/master/glossary_of_socialist_terms.md), and our [Socialism FAQ](https://github.com/sonofevil/essays/blob/master/socialism_faq.md). We allow questions and education, but in order to prevent the sub from getting overrun with things that belong in the 101 subs (such as /r/communism101), we will remove questions that are too elementary.

  * We will not field questions about the basic tenets of socialism, communism, and anarchism. We've provided plenty of links you can read that will answer these questions.

  * We will not field questions that expect us to justify our views to you. Not only have we provided plenty of links, but we also won't have our users harangued with it. Don't ask how we plan to deal with greed, human nature, etc. Don't ask us to justify the USSR, Stalin, Mao, Venezuela, Cambodia, the moons of Neptune, or any of the other people or places or things you think are black marks on socialism's history. Don't ask when socialism has ""worked.""

#HEED THESE WORDS#
Could not be further from the truth. I am simply here to spread the word of anime to the less fortunate. I think astrophysics and anime go hand in hand, like a sword and shield. Like man and woman, as G-d Himself intended for all of us when he went on that drunken bender 6000 years ago today. You don't think that fucker wasn't watching hentai? We're like his 2D, you ever think of that? Like, he's in something more than 3D, so we're like his 2D, like I just fucking said!! And he could still get it up and bust all kind of holy nuts up in them virgin guts on St. Patrick's Day way back when. That's like jerkin' it to Yoko Littner. Am I really so different, G-d!?! Why the fuck have you forsaken me? You know he didn't even pay child support for Jesus, not even once? Fuckin' piece of shit. Informer You know say Daddy Snow me, I'm gonna blame A licky boom-boom down 'Tective man says Daddy Snow stabbed someone down the lane A licky boom-boom down InformerI disagree with that in general. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ಠ_ಠLegislated mandates in sentencing can create some awful tyrannies. I think we need a human dimension to sentencing because I believe that leads, overall, to more humane and constructive corrective value. As long as there is some oversight watching out for unreasonable abusers and a channel to deal with tha t, then I think we are better off in the long run. The law can't anticipate or solve every problem in advance and trying to design it to be that way would make it too unwieldy, burdensome, and in some cases potentially wildly inhumane. Three strikes laws are examples of such failure in the past.

Lots of exposition. The only reason I'm saying eh is the ending ties stuff together decently and is emotionally effective. I also liked how almost every episode had a large time jump. There's also a cool implementation of how the internet could be in the future. It just sucked. Perhaps 4th worst show I've ever seen.

[repeat] [MC Shan:] Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl Police kDetroit Metal City Some say this is There are a couple viable explanations that I have mused about. The first one is the most obvious... Namely that humanity survived into the future without help the first time through... Perhaps just barely. Perhaps only after great loss and long eras of suffering. In this scenario there is no paradox. Why would the future survivors care to reach back in time and aid their struggling ancestors? These humans were apparently masters of time. Maybe from their perspectPeople seem to be overlooking the deviations from the biblical story as sort of random ignorance on the part of the filmakers. But I think these deviations are coherently intentional ... Scott's take on this film seems to have been to cast the plague miracles pretty much as if they were coincidental natural events. And Moses' conversations with God were hallucinatory episodes triggered by a head injury. These hard to believe events culminated in a rebellion by the Hebrews and provoked the one remarkable event that is hard to deny
historically: namely, Ramses allowing the Hebrews to leave Egypt. Perhaps Ridley Scott is saying, in essence, ""Eventually the story of the Exodus got turned into a miraculous mythology. But here, dear viewer, is a plausible rendering of how it all may have really happened.""ive of being able to see through all of time, everyone to them is in the ""present"" (as was apparent in the tesseract construct). Perhaps they chose to reach back in time to render aid to fellow humans out of compassion, to save a lot of lives -- much as we might render aid to less fortunate people today.the Metalocalypse of anime. It's not. They go in the opposite direction. DMC is about a kid moving to Toky who wanted to be an indie pop act, but for some unexplained reason wound up in a death metal band that he hates. And the comedy comes from him stumbling into situations that are way over his head. He's touted as a metal god who mostly lives up to the reputation by accident. It's sometimes really funny. It was obviously cheaplyYour accusations here are way overblown. Your assertion that there is some sort of quality judgement about one music style over another (akin to racism as you imply above) is just not there. She simply chose a music style that she knew that he did not enjoy. That was the point of the message. You should not force other people to listen to your music because they might not enjoy doing so. Comparing this to Guantanamo torture is just way off base. ""Gross overstep""? Hardly! Finally, there's no way he would have to sit and listen to the music for 20 hours straight. He was probably given several sessions to attend... probably something like 5 days in a row for 4 hours each. You just need to wind down a bit and take a look at this again in a couple days.

really stressed out or something? made, because they only animate the part of the screen where things are happening. Sometimes, most of the screen is totally black. And each episode is only ~14 minutes, including a 1.5 minute OP, and most episodes are split into two stories. So the pace is blinding. It doesn't have a real ending.

> # Our Mission
KotakuInAction is a platform for open discussion of the issues where gaming, nerd culture, the Internet, and media collide.

>We believe that the current standards of ethics in the media have alienated the artists, developers, and creators who perpetuate the things we love, enjoy, and enthusiastically build communities around. We have observed numerous incidents involving conflicts of interest and agenda-pushing within media which we feel are damaging to the credibility of the medium and harm the community at large. We believe much of the current media is complicit in the proliferation of an ideology that squashes individuality, divides along political lines, and is stifling to the freedom of creativity that is the foundation of human expression.

>KotakuInAction is a community that condemns willful censorship, exclusion, harassment, and abuse. It is a community that organizes to hold the media accountable to the concept of artistic freedom by standing up for the artist, the developer, the writer, the filmmaker, and all who enjoy the freedom to create, explore, and expand. It is a community that allows the exchange of information, supports the ongoing discussion of media ethics, and protects the right of the individual to embrace their personal interests in entertainment and fandom.

>KotakuInAction is built around a core focus on reasonable, friendly discussion of the issues related to gaming culture, and those involved in it.  That is not all we are about, but it's where we began and will remain our core.  We hold ourselves to be politically neutral ground, not forcing anyone to conform in their opinions, and permitting a wide variety of viewpoints to express themselves in a civil manner.

2qjt4,t5_2qjt4,Lovecraft,"Dedicated to the works of H.P. Lovecraft, this is your stop for all of his outstanding works and weird fiction in general! 

 *Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn*!

***

 **Rules**

1. Keep discussion civil

2. No lighter fare such as: memes, jokes, book covers, tattoos, apparel, etc.

3. Submissions must be clearly related to Lovecraft in some way

4. Credit all creative work with the name of the piece and artist in the title

5. Do not post asking where to start with Lovecraft, [there is a sticky for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/abqa9y/new_year_new_reading_suggestions_looking_for/)

6. All self-promotion must be disclosed and kept within reasonable limits

Use spoiler tags where appropriate.

**Spoiler formatting**

\>!Spoiler!< will appear as >!Spoiler!<

Violation of the rules will result in post removal and in some cases bans.

It helps to report instances of spam and posts/comments that break the rules.

If you have any questions about the rules, please don't hesitate to [message the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLovecraft)

For some more detail on the rules please [**check the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/wiki/index)

[Wikisource](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:H._P._Lovecraft) has most of Lovecraft's works in a pleasant format.  **The Uninitiated should begin with:**

## [Our FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/wiki/faq)

## [What we expect of posters](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/4lho2q/a_reminder_for_what_we_expect_of_this_sub/)

**Quick questions:**

|  Simple Questions | Simple Answers    |  
|:-----------|:------------| 
| **What is this subreddit?** |  This subreddit is a place to both mock and refute the ideas of subreddits that exist solely to propagate bigotry towards a certain race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation, food preference, and the like. A fuller definition of both hate subreddits and our purpose, as well as a list of notable hate groups on Reddit, can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/wiki/hatesubs) More information about our purpose can be found in [our FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/wiki/faq)  **Troll subreddits and subreddits whose purpose is not explicit hatred will not be considered hate subreddits and links to both will be removed.**    |  
| **Why are you doing this?** |  Part of our mission is to get moderators to step up, because it is ultimately them who decide if their community is going to be a hate community or not. If this has no hope of happening, as is often the case with smaller subs, we want to pressure the admins to act. Obviously they aren't going to quarantine or ban a default sub and since it's not our primary goal anyways, we regularly make an exception for defaults, when hateful comments are up-voted and left there by the mods.    |  
| **What if I'm banned?** | Modmail us if you're banned and you believe the ban was unjustified. Please do remember that hurling slurs at the moderators will not improve your chances of getting unbanned. Spamming mod mail is not a good way to get on our good side. |
| **What if I'm from a hate subreddit?** | People from hate subreddits can post here, but there are enforced limitations on what you are allowed do in such a case. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/wiki/hateusers) for more information. Be civil.
---

| Simple Rules   | Those Rules Explained|  
|:-----------|:------------| 
| **Follow the Reddit rules**  |  We enforce the [global Reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) here in AHS; any doxxing or spamming in particular will be met with immediate ban. Given that brigading is against the rules of Reddit,  if you are found to be commenting in a linked post after it was made, you will be banned from further participation in this sub. It goes without saying that calls to violence or doxxing will not be tolerated. |
| **No slurs** |  Racial, ethnic, religious, transphobic, homophobic, misogynist, and other slurs will not be accepted - because we automatically remove them, we recommend that you avoid direct quoting of slurs. Depending on the context and severity, users throwing around slurs will be met with a ban or a warning.| 
| **No deleting comments** | Seriously. It's embarrassing to lose an argument, but deleting comments in a conversation serves nothing but giving you a free one-way ticket to being banned indefinitely.
| **No ban evasion** | This will lead to your alt being banned, and to you being reported to the admins. Ban evasion is a shadowban-worthy violation of the Reddit rules.
|**No calls to violence**| Seriously, none. This is strictly enforced. Strictly. We aren't kidding.
|**Do not debate economic theory**|This is not the appropriate sub to do so. We encourage you to take these matters elsewhere. As a reminder, we take slapfighting and calls to violence seriously here.
|**No shitposting**|This is purely subjective. No slap fights. We may choose to warn you. We may not.

_______________________________

**The Rules**   
    
**Rule 1 - Don't be a jerk**

^It's ^okay ^to ^dislike ^a ^theory ^but ^it's ^not ^okay ^to ^dislike ^a ^person ^because ^they ^don't ^agree ^with ^you, ^so ^please ^treat ^people ^with ^respect.

**Rule 2 - Please provide evidence**

^Evidence ^makes ^for ^a ^good ^theory, ^this ^will ^be ^judged ^at ^the ^discretion ^of ^the ^mods.

**Rule 3 - Theories must be about creative works**

^TV ^shows, ^movies, ^video ^games, ^anime, ^comic ^books, ^novels ^and ^even ^songs ^are ^things ^we ^like ^to ^see, ^but ^events ^pertaining ^to ^real ^life ^are ^not.

**Rule 4 - Tag all spoilers**

^Please ^do ^not ^include ^spoilers ^in ^the ^title ^of ^your ^posts, ^be ^as ^vague ^as ^possible. ^And ^for ^posts ^that ^are ^not ^marked ^with ^the ^spoiler ^flair, ^please ^use ^spoiler ^tags ^in ^the ^comment ^section:

    [Spoiler Text Here!](#spoiler)  

**Rule 5 - Add the media name to your title**

^Whether ^it's ^the ^name ^of ^the ^movie, ^show ^or ^video ^game, ^please ^tell ^us ^what ^you're ^talking ^about ^by ^putting ^the ^name ^in ^the ^title. [^Please ^read ^this ^moderator ^post ^for ^more ^information  ^about ^formatting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/94dah5/folks_please_add_the_name_of_the_media_to_your/)

**Rule 6 - No low effort posts**

^Low ^effort ^posts ^include ^submissions ^that ^are ^just ^a ^title, ^posts ^that ^are ^joke/meme ^related ^or ^those ^with ^no ^evidence ^in ^them.

^We ^also ^do ^not ^take ^too ^kindly ^to ^reposts ^or ^stolen ^content ^either, ^if ^you ^have ^copied ^and ^pasted ^a ^theory ^or ^article ^from ^elsewhere, ^you ^must ^make ^it ^abundantly ^clear ^that ^the ^idea ^belongs ^to ^someone ^else ^and ^give ^full ^credit.

**Rule 7 - High Volume Standard Topics**

^Topics ^we ^receive ^a ^large ^number ^of ^submissions ^about ^will ^be ^subject ^to ^higher ^quality ^standards ^than ^other ^posts. ^We ^ask ^for ^at ^least ^2 ^paragraphs ^of ^writing ^about ^your ^theory ^and ^a ^specific ^citation ^from ^the ^work. ^Subjects ^that ^commonly ^fall ^under ^this ^rule ^include ^blockbuster ^series ^like ^Marvel ^and ^Star ^Wars, ^and ^theory ^ideas ^that ^caught ^on ^like ^""purgatory"" ^theories.

**Rule 8 - Write up your theory if you link to an outside source**

^People ^shouldn't ^have ^to ^leave ^the ^sub ^to ^know ^what ^your ^theory ^is, ^please ^include ^a ^write ^up ^about ^your ^idea.

**Rule 9 - Unapproved advertising**

^Whether ^you ^want ^to ^promote ^your ^podcast, ^Youtube ^channel ^or ^blog, ^we ^do ^ask ^that ^you ^contact ^the ^mod ^team ^via ^mod ^mail ^before ^you ^post, ^but ^we ^are ^more ^likely ^to ^turn ^you ^down ^if ^it ^is ^not ^FanTheory ^related.

**Rule 10 - Posts must be flaired**

^We ^ask ^that ^you ^flair ^your ^post ^based ^on ^these ^criteria:

^**FanTheory** ^- ^A ^theory ^regarding ^past ^or ^present ^works.

^**FanSpeculation** ^- ^A ^theory ^speculating ^the ^contents ^of ^future ^works.

^**Marvel** ^- ^All ^works ^related ^to ^Marvel ^content, ^MCU, ^video ^games ^and ^Comics.

^**Star** ^**Wars** ^- ^All ^works ^related ^the ^Star ^Wars ^franchise.


^**Confirmed** ^- ^Theories ^which ^have ^turned ^out ^to ^be ^right ^but ^must ^be ^back ^up ^with ^supporting ^external ^evidence.

^**Meta** ^- ^Posts ^regarding ^the ^sub-Reddit ^itself.

This subreddet gretly encorages the aduption and care of snek. As thank you, sneks who own a snek are welcome to create their own presssonal flair for this subreddit. All you have to do is send the mods a message! Make sure to title the message ""Snek Owner"" or something that lets us know you have one, and include the flair you wish to have, as well as a photo of your snek with your username and the date on a piece of paper. That's all, ok, bye. 

(Also, don't expect a lightning fast response. We probably ate a mouse already and are digesting)

2xtuj,t5_2xtuj,submechanophobia,"Welcome to /r/submechanophobia; the fear of partially or fully submerged man-made objects. Please respect the following rules while here:

#TITLE RULES:

All titles must accurately summarise the content of the post with as much relevant information as possible. How do we determine what titles are applicable? It's a two step test:

- Does the title describe the content?

- Does the title fit the post in a specific enough manner that it couldn’t be used on any other post?

If one of these tests are failed then the post will be removed and flaired 'title rules', meaning you can resubmit the post with a more suitable title. 

#SUBMITTING AND COMMENTING RULES:

- Check if the submission really is related to submechanophobia. Please nothing that isn't real life; i.e no video games, renderings, CGI etc. 

- Posts can be removed for being low quality. This is applicable on a case-by-case basis, but that could mean such things as poor resolution, not being closely enough related to the subreddit topic, for being clickbait or for having a bad image host. 

- Don't use the line ""I was told to post this here"" or something like ""OMG so creepy!"". It annoys people, they report the comment and it keeps Automod up all night with notifications. This goes for posting irrelevant comments like ""Nope"", ""Fuck that"" or anything similar. 

- No generic memes, jokes or comics. Put them in the comments if you must

- Absolutely no having hostility directed towards one another for mistakes or reposts, we can sort that out. No extreme unpleasantries; the mods will decide how to define that on a case-by-case.

#REPOST RULES:

To be considered a repost:

- If the image, gif, article or album has been used in less than 3 months. After this period you may use it again.

- If the picture is in the first 2 pages of the ""top: all time"" section.

If you see a repost, please report the post and we will deal with it when we can.


***The mod team reserves the right to remove any content deemed of not adequate quality without notification.***

[We now have emotes! See 'em here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lewronggeneration/comments/3d9nvt/about_yesterday/)

This is a subreddit dedicated to satirically mocking those people who, blinded by their own nostalgia, believe certain things in the past to be unequivocally better than today. We place a special emphasis on music, because this subreddit was created after annoyance over ""born in the wrong generation"" attitude often expressed by fans of 60s/70s rock.

##DO

1. Post images or videos of quasi-nostalgic attitudes to music (any genre) or any other media, e.g. TV shows, movies, literature, et al.
2. Be supportive and help people understand. Discussion is always welcome.
3. Report comments or submissions that break the rules, PMing when needed.
4. Censor reddit usernames when posting screenshots. Too many subs have degenerated to being shitty witch hunt clubs.

##DO NOT

1. Post something just because it has an opinion you don't like or disagree with. 
2. Post meta links to reddit, facebook or anything that may lead to personal information. Twitter is the exception, but screenshots are almost always preferred.
3. Post original content or satire, except on saturdays with the proper [SATIRE] tag.
4. Witchhunt or bully. Any instance of digging up info will result in a permanent ban. 
5. Un-ironically put down someone else's musical tastes, unless you're Reese. Try to be open minded. Saying ""X sucks"" and nothing else won't result in a ban, but is frowned upon.
6. PM the mods for flair requests. Use **/r/LWGFlairRequest** instead
7. Be racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/ bigoted in any way. This is left up to the discretion of the moderators. Violators will be banned without warning.
8. Shitpost. Low effort karma whoring, meme spam, lyric chains and the like are not allowed.
9. Act like a fuccboi
10. Take this place too seriously. We're here to have a laugh, not get upset

2tz1e,t5_2tz1e,MorbidReality,"Welcome to /r/MorbidReality, a subreddit devoted to the most disturbing content the internet has to offer. Here, we study and observe the darkest aspects of life and human nature.

Keep in mind, a good post should foster insightful discussion by making you contemplate your humanity and life's struggles.

If you are unsure about how to conduct yourself in this subreddit, **a good rule of thumb to follow is to remain respectful and thoughtful at all times.**

---

#Rules

*Make use of the downvote arrow and report button when encountering rule-breakers.*

>###Breaking any rule is grounds for an immediate ban.
>###The length of the ban is at the mod's discretion.

#Commenting Rules

1 - **Humor at the expense of someone's pain is strictly prohibited.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. Comments should contribute to **thoughtful and serious discussion only**.

2 - **Refrain from promoting hate speech.**This includes but is not limited to; racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, and any other abusive/threatening language. ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature. *Even if the person you are insulting committed a heinous act, do not describe how they should be punished if given the chance.* Keep it in /r/justiceporn.

3 - Unless it is relevant to the discussion, **keep political discussions to a minimum.** Posting comments that are deemed to be baiting an argument, no matter what side of the fence it falls on, will be removed.

#Submission Rules

4 - **Please provide verification from a reliable source** for your submission. This is especially important with submissions that consist only of image(s) or video(s). **Posts that are fake/fiction will be removed**, even if they depict something that happens in real life.

5 - **Submission titles must be descriptive and accurate enough to understand exactly what the content is inside.** Some people are particularly sensitive towards certain topics (e.g. animal abuse, torture) and would rather not look at it in the first place. This also helps prevent sensationalist and biased titles. Posts that have misleading titles will also be removed.

6 - No submissions that rely **solely** on gore in order to be disturbing. We care about the story more often than the actual graphic content. The focus of this subreddit is to focus on personal struggle, **not just pictures of gore, dead bodies, and deformities**. If you want to submit or look at pictures without context behind them, there are many subreddits listed below that can cater to your needs.

7 - This subreddit revolves around the morbidity of **human nature and human-related activities.** Therefore, your submission must have a direct correlation with people (e.g., a lion killing a zebra is **not** allowed. An animal dying to natural causes is **not** allowed. A human abusing an animal **is** allowed. A human dying by an animal **is** allowed).

8 - Check the new tab and search bar before you make a submission. **Reposts will be removed without warning**

--

#General Information

- Trying to cope with suicidal thoughts? Know a friend struggling with depression? /r/SWResources provides counseling and hotline services that may be of use to you.

- Text-based posts are for making requests, posting multiple links, or to engage morbid-related discussion. Want to make a post describing a morbid event you experienced? Consider posting to /r/trueoffmychest or /r/casualiama  instead.

- **Don't downvote someone just because you disagree with their opinion.** Reserve your downvotes for the rule-breakers.

**Subreddit Rules**
=============
 *Users may be subject to temporary bans for breaking any of the main [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/wiki/index), at the sole discretion of the moderators.*

* **This is not a marketplace.** Buying, selling, trading, begging or wagering for coins, players, real money, accounts or digital items is not allowed. Posting anything related to coin buying or selling will result in a ban.

* **Don't be an asshole.** Posts and comments consisting of racist, sexist or homophobic content will be removed, regardless of popularity or relevance. Pictures showing personal information or anything that could lead to doxxing or witch-hunting will not be allowed. Click-baits, shitposts and trolling will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate ban. Treat others how you would like to be treated.

* **Personal Attacks.** We are 100% in favor of critical and constructive posts and comments as long as they are not aimed towards a specific person. Any direct or indirect attack to members of the FIFA community are strictly prohibited.

* **We're not your free advertising or here to pay your bills.** Using the subreddit's subscriber base for financial gain is not allowed. Apps, websites, streams, youtube channels or any other external source to Reddit cannot be advertised. Giveaways promoting another medium (retweet to enter, subscribe to win, etc.) are not allowed. If you wish to advertise, you can do so through reddit. Read what Reddit considers to be acceptable self-promotion [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). 

* **This isn't /r/soccer or /r/memes.** Let's keep this sub related to the FIFA videogame and not about real world soccer news/videos outside of our designated weekend IF threads. Memes are not allowed either. If your post includes content not directly extracted from the game, it will be removed.
* **Automatic Removal.** The [following topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/wiki/index#wiki_subreddit_rules) will be automatically removed by the moderation team due to user feedback, low effort and repetitiveness.

* **If you see something that isn't right, report it.** Clicking the report button under the post is the fastest way to helps us catch anything that might be in violation of the rules. Send a message to [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFIFA) before posting if you have questions about what is and isn't allowed.

* **We reserve the right to remove a post if it is against [the game's TOS](https://help.ea.com/en/help/fifa/fifa-rules/)**

37udm,t5_37udm,fortyfivefiftyfive,"According to [this](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/plastic-surgery-researchers-ask-whats-the-perfect-breast) article, the perfect breasts are those with 45% of the breast above the nipple and 55% of the breast below the nipple. This subreddit is here to celebrate that shape. 

**Rules:**

1. Gifs, pictures, and video are all welcome. 
2. Post only girls with the 45/55 ratios breasts. Close calls will be up to upvotes and downvotes, but clear violations will be removed. 
3. NSFW is required, although it doesn't necessarily have to be nude. Ie, sheer or seethrough clothing is ok. 
4. Posts including faces are STRONGLY preferred. 
5. Pictures can be deceiving. 45/55 ratio is picture by picture, not based on the model as a whole.
6. Posts must be direct links.
7. No obvious reposts, including Top 100 posts and media posted within the last few weeks.
8. Don't impersonate as another user or crosspost their content without giving explicit credit within the title or expressed permission, including a user tag, within a comment in the post.

  8a. Ideal posts include the name of the model in the title.
