And then as I go about my life (off of reddit, in the real world), every time I hear someone say we need a moderate 2020 candidate, I‚Äôll tally it on my phone. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna donate and reset the tally on a weekly or monthly basis yet, but I can post those receipts here as well.

I feel really petty for doing this reddit post, but I don't really know where else to reach out to and have done everything possible to sort this privately.

After winning a gnome at the last Runefest, we were given one gnome; and being a duo - were told that they'd sort us out another golden gnome after Runefest so both of us could have one. Me and Dave agreed between each other that he'd have the gnome, and I'd wait for the new one to come and have that.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to contact Jagex Mods via Twitter DMs - and have been told countless times by different moderators that it was being sent over. I've sent my details over via email multiple times, and has gotten to the point where mods are no longer replying. I get that some people might hit me with the ""It's just a bit of plastic"" but it would be nice for the sentimental value more than anything.

It's a bit of a joke and seems there's a trend of Jagex making false promises and not delivering when it comes to these kinds of rewards (I'm looking at you KOTS winners). The fact that I've had to make this post like many others says it all really about the lack of communication. I'm thankful of Jagex for going out of their way to try and accommodate an award for the two of us, but there's walking the walk, and talking the talk - and I haven't heard any footsteps in 5 months lads.

UPDATE: 

Have been contacted on Twitter to get this sorted - thanks lads for getting this post exposure"

I decided to download PoGo on a whim in Nov when I got a new phone, and it massively improved my exercise routine. Instead of trying to weasel out of going to the gym I was walking 10 laps around my park lake! My weight yo-yoed up and down a lot, but PoGo at least rewarded me for nearly every step. And a month ago, I went to my surgeon nearly 40lbs lighter.

Now I'm asking my girlfriend if we can pull over so I can get my spin for the day before surgery, lol. She and her 5 kids started playing as well, so while I'll be in surgery she's probably going to be doing the event. And hopefully I have enough wits about me this weekend for Ray.

This is literally my first time posting anything on Reddit, so I'm sure I'm going to do all sorts of things wrong. Please be nice? (lol) I've been watching a lot of reddit post videos on youtube (fresh, voicey here, cuestar, etc.), and I've been wanting to share some bizarre things that happened in my life. (Also I guess this is a cliche now but English isn't my first language so sorry if I mess anything up)

This is a long post, so I put a TLDR at the end. 

I was just talking about kindergarten experienced with a friend and remembered this one. So this story takes place a LONG time ago because it happened back when I was like 5 or something. Obviously, I don't remember exact dialogue.

For some background information:

In my country, there are these things called ""American schools"", where you can get American education instead of the country's education. Not only will they teach the students English, but they are also responsible for teaching the students American culture. The kindergarten I went to was one such school.

Now at this kindergarten, the most experienced teacher was in charge of the class with the oldest children, and this teacher was what I can only describe as a witch. Let's call her Ms. R. She was married, but she hated being called Mrs. because it made her sound old. (I have a lot of stories I could tell about her, but today lets stick with this one.) I was one of the unfortunate little children whose turn it was to be in her class.

This story happened while we were preparing for graduation. Each class was to sing a song during the ceremony (if you could even call it that). My class was going to sing ""Grand Old Flag"" because it's American and that's what we learned about at this school. Ms. R wanted each child to choose two flags of any country we liked. But she only really expected the 5-year-olds to pick the American flag and the flag of the country they currently lived in, since she apparently expected they would be the only flags they'd be familiar with. Basically: What she wanted was uniformity, but she didn't *specify that was what she wanted.* 
She then sent us home to think about it, and told us we'll make the flags the next day. 

I was a little ""snowflake"" back then, and I pretty much did whatever I wanted so long as it didn't stray too far from the rules. So even while everyone else in the class pretty much unanimously made US and our country's flags, I decided to make Italy and France. Why? I don't really remember. Maybe I liked the colors? 

Ms. R was MAD. She already really disliked me because of my tendency to want to stray from the rules, so she definitely wasn't nice about it. She told me that she wanted me to fix the flags. She told me that the countries I picked had to be countries I could speak the official language of.
Of course, Ms. R expected me to change the flags to America and my country since I could speak both English and my native language. 

Oh Ms. R. You never learn, do you? Have you forgotten what kind of child I am? 

I ended up making my flags into the Canadian flag and the flag of Great Brittain. 

(I know now that Canada's official language is equally French as it is English, but I didn't know at the time. I just knew someone from Canada that spoke English.) 

TLDR: Teacher told me to draw the flag of a nation that spoke English expecting me to draw US flag, I drew Canada and England just because I could."

And sorry about long post.

&#x200B;

**Little bit of background:**

I buy live crickets and worms every Tuesday to feed my pet lizard and I take a tram home, as I do every day after work.

I'm in the tram, holding on a railing and I have white plastic bag hanging from my wrist. The bag is little bit open from the top and you can see few transparent plastic containers in it. The bag makes this rustling sound and quite noticeable \*pop\* every now and then as the crickets are trying to jump around, hitting the sides of the boxes. And the containers moves around a bit, as a result of that. All this action in the bag attracts the attention of a kid nearby.

Without me noticing, the kid comes to investigate and pulls the bag that is hanging from my wrist, probably to see in better. I instinctively pull my hand back a little bit and the kid loses his balance, we are in a moving tram after all and I didn't see him.

&#x200B;

**Interaction between us begins:**

Me, being my usual polite self: ""Oh, sorry little buddy, didn't see you there, are you OK?""

Kid says nothing, but gets up and just stares my bag, as the sounds coming from the bag gets more intense, as the bag has been disturbed. The mom is staring daggers at me, while being on a phone. I kneel down to the kid and open the bag a bit to reveal 3 plastic containers, two contains about 10 crickets each and bottom one has mealworms in it. Crickets at the top are bright yellow/greenish and now making a lots of ruckus, as more light is going into the bag, prompting crickets to try to escape from their containers.

Kid with his eyes widened: ""WHOA! That's sooo COOOOOL!""

Me, explaining happily: ""Yeah, I'm feeding these bugs to my little lizard, crickets are his favorite bugs and here is a picture of the lizard (which I show to the kid from my phone).""

Kid looks amazed and shortly turns around and runs to his mom few paces away: ""Mommy, mommy, there are a-mi-nals in the bag. Mommy, there are, amani--, animani--, animals in the bag. Come and look at the animals in the bag! Bogs in the bag! There's circr--, cickre--, crikihi--, chi-huahua! Biiig bogs!"" (Sounds like ""dogs"" more than ""bugs"".) All this while the kid is pointing at my precious bag.

I'm thinking I could give the kid one or two crickets, but as soon as the kid would ""open"" his hands to take a look what he got, that cricket would jump and escape. And those might spook some other people, and the kid too. So, nope.

Anyways, the encounter with the kid put a big smile on my face and to his as well.

(As a pro-tip, gold fish net is best tool to capture rogue crickets when they escape in your apartment, if you don't want to release hungry lizard to chase them down.)

&#x200B;

**The crazy mom mode enabled:**

Few moments later, the Mom sighs loudly, rolls her eyes and puts her phone away. She focuses on me and approaches with a facial expression on that would make lemons (and demons) to run away, so she will be ""Karen"" from now on. I already knew somehow what was coming at this point.

Karen says: ""What, you have a dog in the bag? That is no place for animal. It suffocates like that. You need a proper leash for it and let it walk free. That sort of a bag is very bad for the dog.""

She tries to reach for my bag. I pull the bag away from her. Kid is just standing behind her and started to dig through his backpack on the floor. I'm holding on to railing with one hand, so I really can't open the plastic bag quickly enough to show her the contents.

Besides, it's none of her business and I really don't want her to grab the bag. The bag indeed has live insects in it, so I handle it with care and respect (Save the bees and spiderbros etc !), regardless of them going towards inevitable slaughter, executed swiftly by my hungry little lizard.

&#x200B;

Me, trying to explain to her while I'm laughing and dodging her claws, directed to my bag: ""Oh, no, this just food for my liz...""

Karen, angrily: ""Shut it. I know better than you. I know people working in animal shelter. I have cats and dogs, I know how to handle them. Now hand the bag over and let's see it!""

She has this look like she's my elementary school teacher with authority to discipline me and confiscate my bag to inspect it. Every time I'm trying to show her what is in it, she tries to grab it, so I keep pulling it away from her reach.

Karen, as she can't get the bag: ""Give it here! You should not have any animals, you are torturing them like that! Now, give it to me!""

Me, taking a step back: ""It's OK, these are crickets and worms and not going to live for more than few days until...""

I'm trying to get a chance to show her the contents, but as she tries to grab the bag again and again, I keep pulling the bag away from her again and again. This is preventing me to reveal the boxes containing insects and she constantly cuts me off, and pretty much ignores most of the words I say and she seems to have very selective hearing.

Karen: ""What!? You are planning to kill it, and on purpose!? Hand it over! Right now!""

Me, still laughing: ""Oh no. These are crickets. And mealworms. And yes, I bought these for food for another pet, so their end is near. The shop that sells these is at...""

Karen, while still trying to get my bag: ""Don't lie to me! And I said NOW! Hand it over! Give me that bag! NOW! I said NOW! Can't you hear me! N-O-W!""

I'm much taller with huge reach advantage and I'm body blocking her, so she can't get her hands on the bag. This really pisses her off, as the sweet forbidden bag is just outside of her reach and big old stupid me is between her and her prize.

My suppressed laughter really doesn't make things better. I think my snickering is even adding fuel to the fire.

&#x200B;

**Guards intervene:**

Now she gets the attention of the residing guards in the much vacant tram, while I try to keep her away with my free hand. She wants to hear none of my explanations and her shouting brings the guards to us.

Guards, who have seen me taking the tram every day for 5 years at the same time, comes and asks: ""What is going on?""

Karen, flailing her hands wildly: ""This guy has a puppy in the plastic bag that it's going to suffocate! He told me so and I saw the dog! It's chihuahua puppy! Arrest that man! I'm going to take the puppy from him! Give it here! Animal haters like him should not keep dogs! Give it here! Here I said, before you kill it!""

Karen tries to reach my bag yet again and really pushes herself against me for better reach. Guards pulls her off from me and says: ""Miss, please stop. Calm down. We'll check the problem.""

Me: ""Yeah, get off from me you crazy bat and don't touch my crickets!"", and I do this no-no-finger-shake on her and do \*tsk-tsk-tsk\* with a grin.

Karen obviously not calming down, increasing her voice, she tells the guards: ""But he has a puppy that he is killing! I own animal shelter (I thought you said you know someone??), that sort of a person should not keep dogs! That is animal cruelty and he should be in jail! He will drown the puppy!""

Me: ""No, I don't and no, I am not! I have crickets! And worms! Bugs!"", while still keeping my cool and having a bit of laugh.

&#x200B;

One guard turns his attention to me as they step in between of us. I happily give the almost weightless plastic bag for him to have it checked, while the other guard talks to her.

I explain to the first guard: ""These are food for my lizard. I don't have a dog or such, I have no idea what she is about. These are from <Pet-Shop-Name close by>, 3 boxes for a tenner. She must be crazy with that dog nonsense. You've seen me before with the same bag many times."" and we share a laugh.

The guard quickly agrees that I'm not torturing animals or drown puppies as she claims, and gives my bag of crickets+worms back to me. I'm cleared for all wrong-doing and both guards shifts their full attention to her.

(From this point onward, I don't have further engagement with any of them, but the show goes on.)

&#x200B;

Guard: ""Miss, you need to calm down. There are no dogs being harmed. Those are just some crickets he has and...""

Karen who is extremely anti-calm: ""You lie too! I saw it in my own eyes! Murderer!! \*Loud obscenities that I don't understand.\* He has a dying puppy in there! He's going to kill it and it's dying! Give it here! I said give it here! It will get a good home with us!""

She tries to get past the guards to get to me, to no avail. This is clearly pissing her off more and more. I move towards the front of the tram, away from them.

Karen: ""Look! Now he's just walking away! Arrest him! You need to call the police! Animal cruelty is not acceptable! He's getting away! Do something! He's getting away! You are in conspiracy with him, aren't you?!""

&#x200B;

Guards starts to prepare to remove her from the tram at the next stop. As she then realizes that she is being removed when tram stops at the next stop, \*insert surprised Pikachu-face\* for good 10 seconds. Then she starts to berate the guards, which I'm too far to hear properly, and trying to push herself between the guards towards the front, unsuccessfully.

I take a look to the kid and he is playing with some smartphone/tablet type of a thing, blowing raspberries happily, probably playing some driving game. Karen succumbs to the will of the guards and gets the kid and their belongings and they all step out, allowing the tram to continue without delays. Next tram will be there within five minutes, so not much of an inconvenience for them either, besides it was nice and sunny outside.

Hopefully guards would explain to her what they found in the plastic bag: Bugs - crickets - so insects, not dogs or chihuahua puppies. And that she isn't taking it on the kid later, or encounter anyone else besides me, in same situation.

&#x200B;

I hop off at my stop and go home. For next month I was riding at the very front of the tram, just in case she would return at the rear. Maybe she just had a bad day. Or maybe she really, really wanted to have some crickets and worms?

Main thing is that no-one got hurt, apart maybe her pride.

I've seen the same guards (there are maybe 20 different ones at my route) many times after and they still just nods to me quietly, as they've done before.

Anyways, all is well that ends well.

&#x200B;

**I get home right on schedule to feed the little ""de-bugger"":**

My lizard was super excited for getting live food, as he always is. Bonus picture of my little lizard, basking with one of his new (doomed) buddies on top of his head: [http://imgur.com/a/02T4HeK](http://imgur.com/a/02T4HeK)

(Those actually are locust, not crickets, but it's close enough for me, and the guy selling these says these are crickets too. These are 5 week old ones. They actually grow to a length of a cigarette, and deploys wings at week 6. Crickets would be the ones making that chirping noise, these locust are quiet type. Or then I've misunderstood what is what.)

Sorry for complex grammar, English is not my first language, so some parts might not make that much of sense, but hopefully you'll get the point and enjoyed the story.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I buy live crickets and worms to feed my lizard, crazy mom accuses me of drowning a chihuahua puppy. Guards removes her from tram, as she accuses everyone of conspiracy.

&#x200B;

EDIT, about the lizard: Here is another picture when the little leg-snek was much smaller, trying to take a bite of a rock:  [https://i.redd.it/gtsz8361vhl21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/gtsz8361vhl21.jpg) I usually put that rock in his bath, so he has something to climb over.

Also, I named it ""Super"", as I didn't know is it a boy or a girl when I got it, as tiny little baby. After about 1 year, then it starts to become obvious is it a boy or girl.

If you want one, I added a quick guide somewhere in the comments. But do your research properly in any case to ensure well-being of it for years to come.

And as a curiosity: these things have 2 dongs!

EDIT2: Little Super sends thanks for the kind stranger who gave him Gold! üòçü¶ó"

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

There was not one month we were out of pocket..

So this week, actually, I was preparing myself for getting ready for the kids sport expenses (Mental ready) and how I will be telling them that they would have to make use of borrowed gear and from last seasons outfits that might still fit. All 3 kids are Super into Hockey, and they do VERY well. So Let me put this out blunt, I will NEVER take away from my kids the things I never had as a child, So I will make sure that they are happy and unaware of the shit I need to worry about!

Last night, while I was still working, the wife prepared the kids gear, filled their water bottles with coolaid, and got them all ready for bed. Because this is my son's 1st Little League try-outs, we had to get at least something for the little guy, I was just not prepared for it to be in the middle of the month though, but my wife said she had a plan, no need to worry and get stressed at work and all. So my wife took my youngest daughter's old (first) Hockey Stick and without me knowing, wrapped the Pink handle grip with my Black insulation tape...

FFW till this morning, I'm always the first to get to my son's bed, and this morning we were Super excited, HOCKEY TRYOUTS!!! Took out the Kit bag from his closet and out of curiosity took out the stick. I am like ""WTF, the kid can't play with a stick looking like this!"" in front of my boy. My wife came running into the room hushing me down. When I looked around, my son was sitting on his bed, with THE SADDEST FACE I have ever seen, it was so sad that I cried alone in the bathroom afterwards, thinking what a fuckup I am for not even making enough money to just be able to buy him his first Stick! I gave in and said Ok, he can take it with him (I first tried to convince him that the school will give out practice sticks, but that made it worse). A few minutes later, my son was his silly self again, making jokes and laughing, so it made me realise that they don't care about the looks, they don't even care about money or have an idea what affect it has, that did not mean anything to him. But I am surely going to buy him a Whole Kit at the end of this month, even if I have to borrow money for it!

Thanx for reading this far kind people.

Edit: Ok Reddit, Now you have me in Fucking tears again!!!! I really did not think there are so many kind strangers out there really still loving this (Anonymous) person!

The messages have flooded my inbox and I will really try to reply to them all! I now need to go pick up the kids from school so I'll be away for a while. Oh my Wife said the try-outs went better than we expected! I can't wait to hear all the news from my kiddos, Yeah!!

Edit 2: My Son made Team!! I am the proudest dad on earth!!!! Our first game is in 2 weeks, so let's get planning shall we! Oh, daughters are in, as expectedü§£ü§£

It may also seem like I am bragging in this story at times, but this is not the intent and it is all important information. Also, English is not my first language.

&#x200B;

So this is a story that my mother and father recently told me about and I thought I should post it here. I was between the ages of 6 an 10 at the time so this is their version of the events. This story turned out to be longer than I planned so buckle up.

&#x200B;

Scammer: SC

&#x200B;

In 2006, my parents bought a plot of land in a very rich town near the coast. As this was a rich town, the town itself was quite small and the price of land was abnormally high (easily twice that of the average in my country). The plot of land was located in the middle of the village where previously something else had been (I believe greenhouses), but it was removed and 25 plots of land were made available for purchase to build houses on. When my parents bought this plot, it said in the contract that they were buying 1050 square meters of land. Upon further inspection they found out they only received 1030 square meters of land. This was especially crappy because there were poles in the ground which marked each plot, and my father had actually measured whether they were receiving right amount of land before they signed the contract, but the real estate agent that sold the plots (SC) had gone back in the middle of the night and placed the poles in the actual right position and kept the old, larger amount of plot in the contract. Now my parents had paid for 20 square meters more than what they received, and the price of the land being about ‚Ç¨500,- per square meter, this amounted to ‚Ç¨10.000 easily. My parents proceeded to contact SC and were simply told that ''small mistakes like this can happen and everything has been accounted for in the contract we signed'' which is a way of saying the contract allowed for mistakes like this and they were NOT getting their money back. My parents then considered legal action, but were told that the margin of ''mistake'' was too small to get a lawsuit off the ground and thus decided to move on.

&#x200B;

Two years later the house is finished, my family moves in and we start to socialize with the neighbours. A few parties were thrown because the street was now finished with the project of building all the houses and everybody wanted to meet their new neigbours. At one of these parties the topic of construction comes up. Most people didn't encounter big problems, but one neighbour complained about how he had to move his house because the plot he was given was smaller than the plot indicated in the contract he signed and how it had cost him a lot of money. Other neighbours then looked surprised and said they also received less land than indicated in the contract. It turned out SC had pulled the same trick with EVERYONE in the street, giving them exactly 20 square meters less. As there were 25 plots in the streets, this meant the amount he stole was ‚Ç¨250.000. Everybody in the street was livid when they realized this. So the entire street decided to get back at him.

&#x200B;

This is where the fun begins

&#x200B;

Did I mention that this was a small town? Well, that meant almost everybody knew each other and that nothing exciting happened normally. A new street being finished was thus a daily topic for at least the next 2 months. So everybody in my street started talking about their new houses, and would occasionally drop the fact about how SC had practically stolen a lot of money from them and their neighbours.  This of course was told over and over again until the entire village knew these allegations, and being a small town, juicy rumours like this last for what seems like forever. SC knew this, so he contacted pretty much everybody living in our street, begging us to stop talking about it, threatening us with legal action, etc. He never offered to give the money back though. Not that it would have mattered, everybody had already cut their losses and just wanted revenge at this point. So, SC was avoided on the street (he also lived in town), lost many clients and money, etc., although he still made enough money to live in the town.

&#x200B;

But the big blow had yet to come

&#x200B;

The town council and mayor were quite satisfied with the fact that the plots of land were sold so quickly, and that the houses that were build looked so beautiful. They decided to make another plot of land available for another 3 streets with 70+ plots of land in total. Needless to say, every real estate agent from the surrounding area wanted to be the one to broker these plots. Initially, SC was the one who was appointed to do this. However, many people in the community reached out to the council and mayor, telling them to please reconsider their choice of appointing SC. The council and the mayor were sceptical at first, because they didn't know whether these rumours were true or not and they trusted SC, as the last project went so well. However, a few neighbours had friends who were members of the town council and they confirmed the rumours to be true. This eventually meant that SC was removed from the project. Being removed from such a big project was a huge red flag for everyone looking for a real estate agent, so eventually he stopped receiving new clients. 2 years after we had moved in he had moved out of town because of debts. His wife had also divorced him and he lost the custody battle of their daugther.

Edit: wow this really blew up. Thank you all for the support.

FAQ:

**Why didn't your parents go to court or the town council?**

Satellites were not used to measure the land yet, so at the time a small margin of error was permitted when measuring such a plot of land. Because it was only 20 square meters out of 1030 it 'only' amounted to 2% of the property being measured wrong, which was not enough to get a lawsuit against SC. We talked with several lawyers about it and they said the case would be dismissed if we went to court.

Also, the town council was the one who initially made the plots available for SC to sell off. If a court case was brought against him the town council would have lost face (what they obviously didn't want to happen, they are like the local politicians)

&#x200B;

**Where did the additional land go/come from?**

In front of all the plots there is about 2 meters of land which is owned by the town itself. Because nothing was build yet (it was literally just dirt, mud and a few rocks) SC put the poles slightly over the edge of the property in this land. It could have been an honest mistake, but he put the poles back in the middle of the night, refused to refund everyone in the street and told them not to talk about it, so everyone just assumes that he did it on purpose."

Dwarf Fortress is coming to Steam and itch.io, published by Kitfox Games!

***TL;DR***

1. Why Steam/itch? *Health difficulties, uncertain structure of Patreon.*
2. Can I still get the original game free and is it still going to be updated? *Yep!*
3. Why Kitfox Games? *We're friends and helping to handle marketing & customer support.*
4. Are you going to steal any mods? *No!! We're creating an all new tileset, and no one has to have their mods on Steam Workshop.*
5. I don't want to support this version! *Okay, you can still support Tarn (‚Äúthe Toady One‚Äù) and Zach (‚ÄúThreetoe‚Äù) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games) and [PayPal](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html)!*

This is just another way to support the Dwarf Fortress creators!

-----------

***ALL THE DETAILS***

>*Why is Dwarf Fortress on Steam and itch.io now?*

Dwarf Fortress is going premium because **some of their close family members have developed serious health issues within the past 6 months, and money to support them is tight**. As it's a sensitive and difficult matter, please respect Tarn and Zach's privacy about this, but keep some well wishes in your hearts for them.‚ù§Ô∏è

Due to these rising healthcare costs, as well as the [uncertain structure of Patreon](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/crowd-funding-platform-patreon-announces-it-will-pay-out-half-a-billion-dollars-to-content-creators-in-2019.html), they decided it was time for them to have additional means of support.

>*What‚Äôs special about this version?*

For the moment, Tarn and Zach will continue working first on the major villains update for Dwarf Fortress Classic (or, if you prefer, Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress Classic), and getting that stable, before they move on to graphics-related support for the Steam/itch.io premium version.

The premium version will have a few special features like graphics by default, the Steam Workshop, and auto-updates.

>*Can I still play Dwarf Fortress for free?*

Yes!

You will still be able to get Dwarf Fortress Classic for free, same as always! And it‚Äôll still be updated alongside the new premium versions (just without the new art, music, and Steam features), forever.

>*Who owns Dwarf Fortress now?*

Nobody bought or sold anything. Bay 12 Games always has and always will (as far as we know) own Dwarf Fortress and all of its branding and properties. Kitfox is only entitled to a portion of revenue from Steam and itch.io.

>*Who‚Äôs doing the art and music?*

You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from **Micha≈Ç ‚ÄúMayday‚Äù Madej** and **Patrick  Martin ‚ÄúMeph‚Äù Schroeder**. They‚Äôre collaborating on an all-new, from-scratch tileset, as seen in the teaser trailer and screenshots. Meanwhile, [Dabu](https://www.dabuaudio.com/) has composed a few musical tracks, to match the seasons, and some other audio bits and pieces. We hope the easy-to-use Steam Workshop will allow there to eventually be even more mods than ever before.

**However, nobody‚Äôs mods will be included in the Steam or itch.io versions.** Not even Meph‚Äôs. **After the villains update is out and stable,** Tarn and Meph will work on the Steam Workshop pipeline to make sure anyone who wants to can easily bring over their mods, if they want to.

If you prefer your old mod packs, feel free to keep using those. They will continue to be compatible with Dwarf Fortress Classic. 

>*I love Dwarf Fortress and just want to support its creators! What is the best way?*

[Donation](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games) are always going to be the best way to get money directly to Tarn & Zach. If you want access to the Steam and itch.io features, 80% of that purchase will also go to them.

>*What‚Äôs changing about the game to make it ‚Äúfit‚Äù Steam and itch.io?* 

Nothing. It‚Äôs still Dwarf Fortress. A few bells and whistles won‚Äôt change that. Graphics will make it easier for some people to play and Steam Workshop will make it easier for more people to use mods. The gameplay will remain the same across both Steam/itch.io and Classic versions. 

>*Should I use the old forum or Discord or what???*

Tarn and Zach won‚Äôt be changing how they do things, so the old [Bay 12 Games forum](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/) (or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bay12Games)) is best for talking to them. For chatting with other fans, Kitfox recommends the [new official Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/kitfoxgames), but it‚Äôs fine to stick with whatever community you are comfortable with. This is the beginning of a new era with lots of new players, so things might shift around a bit.

-----------

ABOUT KITFOX

>*Who is [Kitfox Games](https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames), anyway?*

Oh hey there! We‚Äôre a small indie studio (8 people) in Montreal, Canada. We‚Äôve made other games like  [Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, and the upcoming Boyfriend Dungeon. We‚Äôve also published The Shrouded Isle and the upcoming Six Ages.](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/kitfoxgames)

>*Why work with Kitfox Games?* 

Tarn and Zach wanted more people to know about Dwarf Fortress, and didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time dealing with Steam and journalists and so on. They want to make video games, including more Dwarf Fortress, and not be hassled with selling and negotiating and so on. So Kitfox is acting as a publisher to help with marketing, Steam/itch.io logistics, and paying for other needs like artist contracts, music, PAX booths, etc. 

Steam/itch.io and Kitfox will get cuts of the sales on those platforms, so if you want to give MAXIMUM money to Tarn and Zach, [direct donation](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html) is the way to go. 

Kitfox has no access to the source code, and will have no influence on the design, programming, or updates to Dwarf Fortress. The point of the whole endeavour is to Tarn and Zach focus on the game development, not distract or change what they‚Äôre doing.

After Steam/Itch.io‚Äôs cut, Kitfox will receive 20% of each sale, which is a lower percentage than most publishers, leaving 80% for Bay 12 Games. 

>*How do you all know each other?*

Tanya (Kitfox‚Äôs Captain) met Tarn some years ago through mutual indie friends (thanks Kepa!), and found they had a lot of interests in common. Okay, mostly procedural generation and indie games, but also cats and mythology. They‚Äôve been on multiple PAX [panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pc8li4fuQ) and edited [2 books about procedural generation](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195) together.

Before meeting Tarn, Tanya took a class from a friend on how to play Dwarf Fortress (hi Joachim!) and was inspired by the experience to keep exploring the weird, wonderful world of procedural systems. So when Tarn said he was worried about healthcare and Patreon, she offered to help. We hope it all works out! :)

***This is just another way to support the Dwarf Fortress creators. You can still get DF for free, just like before.***"

These headphones are incredibly nice and a gift from my parents. I had just gotten off work and was in business casual, khakis and a plain grey polo. No logo. Nothing to indicate that I worked at Walmart. 

I was looking in the freezer section for some ice cream for dessert that night when someone yank my headphones off my head and they fall on the ground. 

Cue Karen starting to yell at me. ""I have been trying to get your attention for five minutes! You shouldn't be listening to music while you work! How can you help customers if you can't even hear them!?"" She screeched at me. Now I am seeing red. If she damaged my headphones there was going to be hell to pay. 

I lean down to pick up my headphones and I say to this crazy bitch. ""Don't you ever fucking touch me you crazy bitch. I don't fucking work here you stupid fuck. Touch me again and I will scream so loud the whole store will hear.""

""Don't you talk to me like that! I am a customer!"" She said as she grabbed my bicep to haul me to a manager like a child to be punished. So I let her have it. 

I screamed the loudest scream I could possibly imagine. I actually lost my voice for the next day because of it. It startled her so bad that she let me go and dropped her purse.  Not even 20 seconds later a manager comes running with the security guy. 

The manager demanded to be told what was going on. I told him this crazy bitch assaulted me. She tore my headphones off my head and grabbed me. I feared for my life (a complete imbelishment) so I screamed. By now we have an audience, and the manager takes us both and separates us.  

Luckily for me, a very nice woman was a little farther down the aisle and saw the whole thing and told the security guy what happened and backed up my story. The manager asked if I wanted to press charges and I told him no. I just want my ice cream and to go home. He told me to take it. It was on him. 

As I was leaving I saw the crazy bitch getting thrown out of Walmart by the security guy and being told to never set foot in the store again.

TLDR: lady assaulted me, so I screamed so loud I couldn't talk the next day. Got free ice cream that helped the sore throat. 

edit: My headphones were okay. If she had damaged my property I was going to press charges. But since they weren't, I felt the public humiliation was enough. "
b0n24q,3eh4tmnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b0n24q/to_the_devs_from_an_epileptic_gamer_that_likes/,to the devs from an epileptic gamer that likes looter shooters,964,0.96,1552489713.0,65,,False,True,False,False,False,2xiqd,"To the lovely devs that made The Division 2,

I have to say I love the game and it looks amazing despite my laptop settings are all set to low. The game feels like it is a 2019 game in the sense that the level of detail even at the lowest setting is amazing. Maybe it is the rose tinted glasses of this being a new game but it feels vastly improved in the hours of the game on pc that i played. Also the settings have colourblind mode and other accessibility settings which are a warm welcome as someone who has struggled with colourblindness and text size issues in games.

However, I have to inform you of a glaring issue of the game from my own perspective. Everytime one has to open the inventory or any menus there is like a strobe light flickering effect which is nice but as someone who suffers from epilepsy it is anything but lovely. Every time I have to go to the inventory or menus or speak to the vendor I run the risk of having a grand-mal seizure due to this effect. Therefore I am humbly asking if there can be a little ""meet mid-way"" option to have that effect be toggle on/off so that people who like that effect can still enjoy it and for someone like myself have the option to turn it off so that I can enjoy the game like I did with division 1. As further note someone might argue that the lightning in-game should cause concerns too but from my own experience it causes no issues as it is not the entire screen strobe lighting every time I need to use the menus or inventory. So far I have experienced migraine like headaches and epileptic auras where I have had to stop take a few moments or lay down and hope that I do not have a grand mal seizure.

Furthermore as an epileptic sufferer, I understand that you have the epilepsy warning and others might say I should probably not play the game if it is going aggrevate the seizures. However, as a gamer in this day and age I think it is not too much to ask as the game already has accessibility options to just make one more additional concession request.

Yours faithfully,

one shy disabled gamer who loves his gaming...probably a bit too much \^.\^"

I'm on mobile so sorry for the formation also English is not my native language feel free to correct any mistakes.

This is my moms revenge and it happened 13 years ago. 

Backstory: 

My dad passed away 22 years ago, before I was born, I have an older brother and of course my amazing beautiful Mom. The guy who did it, let's call him Ben, was unfortunately my fathers best friend before he passed away they knew each other for years. After my parents met, Ben and my mom got to know each other as well, they got along pretty well and soon became friends. Fast forward a couple of years my mom got pregnant with my brother and he didn't show any signs of being a pedophile or anything he spend a lot of time with my brother and eventually became his godfather. Two years later my dad passed away while my mom was pregnant with little me. Ben helped her as much as he could in those bad times, gifting us toys and buying food for us and everything. 

The happening:

I was 9 when it all started. He often would stay over night drinking with my mom (I hated it, he'd always wait until my mom went to bed, drink some more and do horrible things to me). My mom never suspected a thing and he would threaten me and say he'd hurt or kill my mother if I said anything so i kept it to myself. After the worst and last time I couldn't keep it to myself anymore so I told my mother the morning after he left. She was furious and cried, blaming herself for not seeing the signs and went to the police with me immediately where we filed a report. (They got to his home and searched his computer where he had child porn and arrested him) I'll skip the boring part of going to various doctors and the trial. He did get sentenced to 3 lousy years in prison. (I'm still mad at this) 

On to the revenge: 

So my mom had connections to people who had connections to prisoners who were luckily in the same prison as he was,she told them what had happened, who he was and everything they wanted to know. A few days later my mom got a call from our lawyer who told her he had to get transferred to another prison because the inmates threatened to kill him and beat him up pretty bad. My mom was happy about that. But what he had done kept spreading from prison to prison so he had to be transferred multiple times because he kept getting beat up ( I don't exactly know how many times). After he was released from prison three years later he was registered as a sex offender and wasn't allowed anywhere near children. 
He moved far away from our city  and tried leaving all of it behind although my mom told me he had trouble finding a job. 

I haven't heard of him in years but think of him almost everyday, how he destroyed my life but I do have to smile thinking of all the beatings he must have had.

Thank you for making it to the end and thank you to all prisoners who beat the living shit out of this fuck face!

Edit: changed his name from FF to Ben (not his real name)

Edit 2: thank you so much for the silver! I'd never thought this would blow up like that!

Thank all of you for your love and support!"

I‚Äôm from the UK, where this whole thing with the lab is unheard of, so I was already a little thrown off with walking a cross the street with my own bodily fluids in my bag, but whatever. 

The lab had a reception and a waiting room but it‚Äôs all very open plan, and you could even see the technicians doing science-y things in the background. There was no one at the desk so I waited. There were a few people sat in the waiting room. 

What I noticed straight away was a random urine sample just sitting in the middle of the desk, next to the keyboard. You could literally see the pee inside and it made me feel sick. Why was it just sitting there ? Anyone could reach out and grab it. It also was unlabelled. 

The receptionist returns sometime later chewing the end of a snack (gross) with a few crumbs down her top. Ignoring me, a whole debacle begins between her and a technician about the random urine sample- ‚Äòwho left that there, who‚Äôs is it, what is it‚Äô etc. After a lot of unprofessional back and forth with me just staring at them, the sample gets whisked away. 

Receptionist eventually turns to me and we begin the most uncomfortable transaction of my entire life. 

She asked me what sample I had and what I was specifically getting tested for. I quietly told her that I was worried about chlamydia and gonnorhea. She‚Äôs running her finger down this looong price list humming/ singing and making noises as if to imply she‚Äôs thinking/ searching. 

Her: (loudly) ‚Äúdun dun dunnnnnn, da da daaa, okayyy chlamydia, chlamydia, chlamydiaaaaa, Ah! Here we go! Chlamydia- that‚Äôs X dollars.‚Äù

Her voice was so loud and there was no music in the waiting room. Everyone heard. I look around HORRIFIED because this lady has no sense of confidentiality. Before I could stop her she was on to the next one. 

‚ÄúHm hmm hmmmmm, gonnorhea, gonnorhea, where‚Äôs the gonnorhea, Ah here it is...‚Äù etc 

She priced it up and I paid and ran the fuck outta there so quickly. 

Tests came back a few weeks later and luckily all negative by the way for those wondering ;)  


Edit: to those wondering why I didn‚Äôt put my foot down and tell her to shut the fuck up for violating my privacy/ confidentiality laws- I am a very non confrontational person and I was totally cringing about the situation drawing attention to myself anyway. I was also in a pit of severe anxiety about potentially having these STIs. If you‚Äôve ever had to go through the whole doctors/ testing thing it‚Äôs a very sobering experience which makes you feel guilty and like you‚Äôve been an idiot so forgive me for just wanting the whole thing to be over! 

After all the comments I reckon I‚Äôll put a complaint in tomorrow. 

Chur!

---

### Wild Appalachia 

- **New Questline ‚Äì Wasted on Nukashine**
 - Begin this questline by finding and reading one of the Party Invitation Posters that VTU students have plastered throughout Appalachia, including at Train Stations, to join in the revelry. 
 - Party Invitation Posters are also available for **free** in the Atomic Shop until **9:00 a.m. EDT on April 9**. Once claimed, you can place the poster in your C.A.M.P. and read it to begin the quest.
- **New Crafting System ‚Äì Brewing and Distilling**
 - A new Brewing Workbench has been added that you‚Äôll learn to build by completing the Wasted on Nukashine questline. Use it to craft a variety of new Wines, Spirits, Beers, and Mixed Drinks that will temporarily apply positive and negative effects when consumed.
 - Several Brewing and Distilling Daily and Weekly Challenges have also been added.
- **New C.A.M.P. Object ‚Äì Fermenter**
 - Some drinks require fermentation time before they‚Äôre ready to be consumed. Wines and Spirits can also be aged further to gain additional, more powerful effects.
 - The Fermenter C.A.M.P. object has been added to aid in this process and can be unlocked by completing Wasted on Nukashine.
 - Brew up a new batch of drinks using the Brewing Workbench and then use the Fermenter to select those concoctions and age them twice as fast.
- **New Daily Quests ‚Äì Brewing and Distilling**
 - Once per day, after you‚Äôve completed the Wasted on Nukashine questline, you can speak to Biv to continue experimentation and occasionally learn new recipes.
 - Sometimes, you‚Äôll be asked to imbibe various types of alcohol and perform specific tasks. Other times, you‚Äôll learn a new recipe and will need to craft the brew to Biv‚Äôs satisfaction.
- **New Seasonal Event Quest ‚Äì Fasnacht Parade**
 - This repeatable, limited-time event will be available for one week, from March 19 - 26.
 - Travel to the town of Helvetia to aid the local Protectrons as they prepare for the annual Fasnacht celebration and parade. Guide the bots to the end of their parade route to claim new loot, which may include new C.A.M.P. plans, and gain a chance to earn a fantastic Fasnacht mask.
 - There are many Fasnacht masks up for grabs, and some are exceedingly rare. Trade with your friends to acquire any particular mask that catches your eye.
- Check out our recent articles on Fallout.com to learn more about Brewing and Distilling and the Fasnacht Parade Seasonal Event.

### General

- **Server Maintenance:** The messages displayed when servers are taken offline for maintenance have been updated:
 - The message displayed when an individual server is shut down for maintenance is now: ‚ÄúPlease join another World. This World will be undergoing maintenance soon.‚Äù
 - The message displayed when Fallout 76 is brought offline for maintenance is now: ‚ÄúGame Services are shutting down for maintenance soon.‚Äù

### Atomic Shop
 
- **Change Appearance:** Players can now preview Atomic Shop items while navigating the in-game Change Appearance menu.
 - After entering Change Appearance from the menu on the Map, Atomic Shop items such as hairstyles and tattoos will now populate the list of appearance changes that players can preview.
 - Select an item and then choose ‚ÄúView in Atomic Shop‚Äù to open the Atomic Shop and unlock that item using Atoms.
- **Workbenches:** Players can now also preview Atomic Shop items, such as paints, headwear, and outfits, from the list of craftable items that appears after entering a Workbench.
 - This functions much like previewing Atomic Shop items in a Workshop, or in the Change Appearance menu as mentioned above.
 - Additionally, a toggle has been added that players can use to show or hide unowned Atomic Shop items in a Workbench‚Äôs craftable item list.

### Balance Changes

- **Energy Weapons:** The amount of condition damage heavy energy weapons take per shot has been greatly reduced, and they should now last 4 to 5 times longer before needing repairs.
- **Energy Weapons:** The amount of condition damage semi-auto energy weapons take per shot has been reduced by half, and they should last twice as long before needing repairs.
- **Energy Weapons:** Base damage for semi-auto energy weapons has been increased by 10%.
- **Heavy Weapons:** High rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons have had their fire-rates reduced across the board, and weapon damage has been increased by +10% to maintain their original damage per second.
 - **Dev Note:** For high rate-of-fire heavy weapons, we wanted to drastically increase their effective damage per second against armor without pushing their baseline damage per second too high. This change in fire-rate provided room for a damage increase to help punch through armor more effectively.
- **Heavy Weapons:** Weapon damage for all other automatic heavy weapons has been increased by 10% to 20%.
- **Heavy Weapons:** The amount of condition damage automatic ballistic heavy weapons take per shot has been reduced by 75%.
 - **Dev Note:** We hope that some of these adjustments for energy and heavy weapons will help your guns feel more useful, from their durability to their ammo consumption rates. We know that some in the community have also been asking for weight changes for heavy weapons. While we haven‚Äôt addressed that in today‚Äôs patch, we do plan to make improvements with a future update and we will let you know as soon as we‚Äôre ready to share more details.
- **Flux:** Different types of Flux have had their weights and sell values adjusted:
 - **Stable Flux:** Base value increased to 100 Caps.
 - **Raw Flux:** Base value reduced to 10 Caps.
 - **Inert Flux:** Weight reduced to 0.2 pounds, base value reduced to 0 Caps, and can no longer be sold to Vendors.
 

### C.A.M.P., Crafting, and Workshops

- **Budget Adjustments:** Some C.A.M.P. objects, such as Turrets and Lights, now consume far less budget, but also have a maximum amount that can be placed in a C.A.M.P. or Workshop.
 - These object recipes in the crafting menu now display how many of that item have already been built by the player in a C.A.M.P. or Workshop, including how many they have stored, as well as the maximum amount that can be placed.
 - **Dev Note:** Adding a max count to certain objects allows us to reduce those objects‚Äô budget costs, while allowing us to keep an eye on their specific usage, as well as balance and performance. As a result, you‚Äôll be able to build more stuff, and we‚Äôll have more flexibility to refine and adjust C.A.M.P. and Workshop structure balance and performance.
- **C.A.M.P. Placement Adjustments:** Occasionally, new game content may need to occupy a space in the world that was previously usable as a C.A.M.P. location. When this occurs, a new no-build zone will be placed in that spot, preventing players from building there in the future.
 - If a player‚Äôs pre-existing C.A.M.P. location would overlap a new no-build zone on joining a world, a notification will now inform them that their C.A.M.P. cannot be placed, and they will be given one free C.A.M.P. placement.
- **C.A.M.P.:** Several additional environment objects, such as grasses, ferns, and swamp fungus, will now disappear when the player builds C.A.M.P. objects on top of them.
- **Radios:** Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.

### Design and Gameplay

- **AFK Timer:** The timer that disconnects players after a period of inactivity is now 25% longer when sitting or sleeping.
- **Carry Weight Limit:** A new ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option will now appear in place of the ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù option when a player who has exceeded the absolute maximum weight limit of 1,500 pounds plus the character‚Äôs current carry weight views items in their inventory.
 - Selecting this option will destroy the selected item. This can be repeated with additional items until the player‚Äôs total weight meets or falls below the absolute limit.
 - While above the absolute weight limit, items can no longer be dropped, traded, or consumed. They can only be kept or destroyed.
 - **Dev Note:** As part of our ongoing quest to improve the game‚Äôs overall economy, performance, and address items created as a result of exploit abuse, we‚Äôve decided to implement a ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option for players who have surpassed the absolute weight limit. This should also help reduce cases of excessive item hoarding, as well as prevent duped items from being dropped and making their way into unsuspecting players‚Äô hands.

### User Interface

- **Challenge Tracking:** A tracker has been added to the Map to help players take note of their current active Challenges at a glance, and enable them to monitor progress on the Challenges they choose to track.
 - Players can now access the Challenges menu directly from the Map and selecting a Challenge from the list will add it to the tracker.
 - Open the Map at any time to view any tracked Challenges, as well as progress toward Challenge completion. 
 - Notifications will now display whenever progress is made toward a tracked Challenge.
- **Player Reporting System:** A new ‚ÄúReport Player‚Äù option has been added, and will appear below the ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù option upon clicking a player‚Äôs name in the Social Menu.
 - Clicking ‚ÄúReport Player‚Äù will open a reporting menu that features several reporting options, including: Cheating/Exploiting, Harassment, Offensive Name, and Real-World Threat.
 - Some reportable behaviors may fall under one of these categories. For example, offensive language can be reported using the Harassment category, and scamming or using bots can be reported as Cheating/Exploiting.
 - Selecting one of the above reporting options will send a report to the Bethesda Customer Service team for further investigation.
- **Main Menu:** The background video that plays while viewing the Main Menu has been updated with a new Wild Appalachia themed video.
- **Main Menu:** The Atomic Shop option on the Main Menu will now appear greyed-out with a loading spinner until the Shop is fully loaded.
- **Chat Volume Setting:** A new Chat slider has been added to the Audio Settings menu and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the volume of incoming voice chat.
- **World Radios Setting:** A new World Radios slider has been added to the Audio Settings menu and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the volume of all in-world radios. The existing Radio Volume slider has been renamed Pip-Boy Radio, and both settings can be adjusted independently of one another.

b0hri5,2dstsvp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b0hri5/tifu_by_getting_high_going_to_the_wrong_floor_in/,"TIFU by getting high, going to the wrong floor in my flat building and thinking I travelled back in time",13484,0.89,1552451519.0,452,,1552492358.0,True,False,False,False,2to41,"So this happened a few months ago.

I live in a flat a building consisting of 74 flats, all identical in layout. This also means all floors apart from the main entrance are identical as well. It‚Äôs set up so you can get the stairs or the lift to your floor, and as you exit the stairs/lift, there‚Äôs a door leading to a hallway where a row of flats are, which you need a fob key to get into. (Relevant).

So I got home after a smoke session with a friend and got in the lift. I pressed the button to go to my floor and go up. Once I‚Äôm on my floor I don‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary, until I go to unlock the door that needs the fob key. The small picture of a key in a square indicating where to put the fob key was different. I thought, ‚Äúhey, maybe they changed it when I was out, that‚Äôs a little weird though‚Äù. My stoned little brain didn‚Äôt realise I‚Äôd only been out for a couple of hours at most, and I‚Äôd gotten back at around 11pm, so what would‚Äôve been my first clue that something was amiss went completely over my head. 

For some reason, the fob key worked to get into that hallway even though it wasn‚Äôt my floor, and the first thing I notice is the flat door to my left is different. And by different I mean that all the doors to the flats in my building are all similar, heavy fire doors in either black, white or red. This one was bright blue and looked very, very outdated, with two large frosted windows on top of one another vertically with a letterbox in between. I also noticed how outside every flat there were bikes which I‚Äôd never seen before. 

As I walked along the hallway toward my flat I start freaking out. The old looking door. The bikes. The different fob. The whole hallway just seemed so off, it didn‚Äôt seem like the one where my flat is located. But the only logical explanation to me wasn‚Äôt that I‚Äôd accidentally gone to the wrong floor, like anyone who wasn‚Äôt that stoned, or anyone with half a brain cell would think, oh no. There was only one thought on my mind and that was,

 ‚Äúoh my god I‚Äôve gone back in time, this must be what the building looked like years ago! Oh my god what the fuck do I do?!?‚Äù. 

This thought was with me for about 30 seconds until I reached ‚Äúmy‚Äù door. My heart was racing, my palms began to sweat. I had no idea what was going to be on the other side of that door if I‚Äôd gone back in time. I got my keys out and was about to go to unlock the door when I noticed. . . The wrong door number. I was on the wrong floor. I must‚Äôve pressed the wrong floor button in the lift. 

My fear turned into me giggling to myself as I realised my mistake and how silly it was that even for half a minute I genuinely believed I‚Äôd gone back in time. I hurriedly exited to the right floor and into my flat. It‚Äôs probably the most stupid thing I‚Äôve done whilst high. 

TLDR: Pressed the wrong button in the lift in my flat building where all floors look the same, ended up on the wrong floor but was too stoned to realise, thought the only logical explanation was that I‚Äôd gone back in time. 

EDIT: Wowowowow thanks for gold!!!! 

EDIT 2: To people saying I made this up or they haven‚Äôt been that fucked up from smoking or whatever, this literally happened in the span of like a minute, it was a huge brain fart from being high. I smoke most days but rarely anything like this happens, and that‚Äôs what makes it so funny to me! I wasn‚Äôt fucked up or anything, I just had the biggest brain fart from being stoned! 

EDIT 3: this 100% happened. I swear to god. Tbf I guess the story is dramatised a bit to make it entertaining, but for that half a minute I genuinely was scared I‚Äôd gone back in time, it was momentary lapse of judgment! Weed can do strange things to your brain and make you think things for a FEW SECONDS that obviously aren‚Äôt a thing. Paranoia is one hell of a side effect of smoking weed. I couldn‚Äôt make this story up lol "

Just never go without complaining if you are paying for next day delivery. Hope this helps some peeps.

b0lu27,15yfk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b0lu27/theres_a_ghost_in_my_room_and_i_think_im_haunting/,"There's a Ghost in my Room, and I Think I'm Haunting Him",1041,0.94,1552482608.0,49,,False,True,False,False,False,2rm4d,"There‚Äôs a ghost that haunts my room, and he‚Äôs the best part of my home. 

I don‚Äôt think my Daddy wanted a daughter. Or at least, he didn‚Äôt want one after his wife couldn‚Äôt be my Mommy. All he ever said about her is that we can‚Äôt stop death, and then got really quiet.

He never wanted to talk about her after that.

I always wondered how much control he had over his own life. If you can‚Äôt stop death from happening, why would you stop life from happening? Because that‚Äôs the choice he made.

He never took me places. Friends weren‚Äôt allowed inside our home. To be honest, he never seemed really happy being my Daddy.

There might have been more to that story. But like I said, my room is haunted, which prevents me from seeing all of the things that happen inside my house.

I was very scared the first time that the ghost came for me. I felt like I was falling asleep, but then I was falling. I fell faster and faster, and I wanted to wake up, but something was pulling me far away. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, and everything was really dark.

Then it was warm and peaceful. I met the ghost, but I couldn‚Äôt see him. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, but all of my senses were gone. I knew that he was in front of me, but my body was missing, and there was light. I felt the light instead of seeing it, and that made it real.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to take you away,‚Äù he said. The ghost didn‚Äôt use words, but I knew what he meant just the same. ‚ÄúWhy are you taking me from my bed?‚Äù I thought, and he understood. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only for a short time,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI will be in your place, in your bed, and your father won‚Äôt be able to tell that it‚Äôs me instead of you. When it‚Äôs over, you can go back home.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut where will I go until then?‚Äù I thought, and the ghost quickly answered back. ‚ÄúYou will stay here, where it‚Äôs warm and safe. I will fetch you when tonight is over.‚Äù

I wanted to ask more, but he was gone. 

I was warm and safe.

And when I returned to my own bed that night, I still felt warm and safe.

It would have made sense to be afraid when I fell through the darkness and into another world. It would have made sense to doubt the ghost who pulled me from my room and took my place at night. Yet I wasn‚Äôt afraid. I could feel goodness in the ghost.

But I felt sadness, too. 

It got stronger as time went on. The ghost would be in front of me for just a second when I came into his world. Each time, he got colder. Each time, he spoke less. 

I wanted to make him feel better, but I didn‚Äôt know how. I wondered, then, if this was the part of growing up that no one talks about. Maybe everyone can see pain in the people around them, but just don‚Äôt understand what to ask about why it‚Äôs there, even where the suffering person only needs to *share* a story that nobody knows how to talk about.

I wanted to tell my Daddy stories about the ghost that came into my room at night. But whenever I tried, he got very red and quiet. Sometimes, he would walk away, and I would hear a breaking sound. Later, I would find fresh fist-sized holes in the walls.

Every so often, the other world would swallow me up while I was talking to Daddy, and the ghost would take me in the middle of the day. It would still be daytime when I returned, but my Daddy always avoided me until the next morning.

I don‚Äôt think he wanted to hear my stories. I never understood why; all I wanted was someone to share them with. 

And it‚Äôs not even important to believe the story a friend tells you. Most of the time, the friend just wants to know they‚Äôre valuable enough to be heard.

Even though I was very young, I still understood that a man should value his daughter.

I didn‚Äôt know how to solve the problem, so I learned to stop talking about it. No one wanted to hear what I had to say.

So the problem spoke for itself.

It just got bigger and bigger because no one was listening. And suddenly, everything changed.

I counted nineteen punches in the wall that night, and thirteen seconds later, my door was rattling on its hinges. I didn‚Äôt understand *why* I had to be afraid, but I knew *that* I did. Sometimes, there is no ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when people are scared.

I put my faith in the door‚Äôs lock.

My faith was broken.

I was falling. The ghost passed by me on the way down, and I could feel the fear wrapping around him like swirls of pure white cream in black coffee.

I was rising. But I immediately started falling again, and nothing made sense, and everyone was spinning around each other. 

Then I was in the ghost‚Äôs home. I was warm. I was safe.

I was pulled out again.

I landed on my bed hard enough to bounce. I gasped for air and sat up. It smelled like pennies. I felt a thick layer of sticky, red liquid pour down my shirt.

My father‚Äôs silhouette remained still at the other end of the room. I was confused, because he didn‚Äôt look angry. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he whispered, strange and familiar all at once. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt stop death. No one can.‚Äù

I was uncomfortable, and I wanted to cry. But the worst kinds of tears are those shared with people who don‚Äôt care, so I had learned not to cry around my Daddy.

He took in a deep breath, and I understood that *he* was crying softly in the dark. 

‚ÄúWho died?‚Äù I asked quietly.

He froze for several seconds. ‚ÄúYou did.‚Äù

I felt the liquid on my chest, then looked down at my fingertips. An angry shade of red was barely visible in the moonlight streaming through the window.

I panicked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs a reason,‚Äù my Daddy continued slowly. ‚ÄúGrowing up means letting things go.‚Äù

I struggled to breathe. ‚ÄúWhat has to be let go?‚Äù

His voice rattled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I tried to stop it. But your Daddy‚Äôs anger was too much this one time, which means it was too much forever.‚Äù He extended his trembling fist into the tiny swath of moonlight.

It was covered in red.

I gasped. ‚ÄúAm I going to-‚Äù

‚ÄúI switched you,‚Äù he responded simply. ‚ÄúYou could only go into the other place when someone was willing to stand in for you. So no, you will not die.‚Äù

My head spun. I wanted to throw up.

‚ÄúYou *were* going to the other place,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúand then death came, and it couldn‚Äôt be stopped. So it was time to switch again. I‚Äôm sorry you went back and forth so many times. But someone had to be in your place, someone had to be in Daddy‚Äôs place, and the most important thing is that death had to take one of us.‚Äù He cried loudly now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I don‚Äôt know why it was my responsibility to care for you, but that‚Äôs just the way things are.‚Äù

He wiped his eyes. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think he was a good Daddy. It couldn‚Äôt be stopped, and you deserved to be saved from death much more than he did.‚Äù

I wanted to ask so many questions, but they all got stuck on the way out of my mouth.

‚ÄúBut I couldn‚Äôt leave you all alone. Not after spending so much time protecting you by switching our bodies when your Daddy came for you at night.‚Äù

He got very quiet.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the ghost?‚Äù I asked in wonder. ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre in my Daddy‚Äôs body?‚Äù

He nodded in the moonlight.

‚ÄúAnd my Daddy is-‚Äù

He nodded again. ‚ÄúHe made a decision to bring death into the room, so I made the decision that *he* would be the one to face it.‚Äù

I began to understand. ‚ÄúBut ‚Äì when can you go back to your home, where it‚Äôs warm and safe?‚Äù

He gave a very long sigh. ‚ÄúDeath closes doors that can‚Äôt be opened again.‚Äù

I trembled. The shaking wouldn‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs your home! Won‚Äôt your family miss you?‚Äù

He sniffed. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

We were silent for some time.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be your dad. There aren‚Äôt any instructions. I have to start failing at it, or I won‚Äôt learn anything at all.‚Äù He finally wept, openly but gently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre stuck with me. I tried to do my best, but sometimes we can only choose the smallest failure.‚Äù

I sprang out of bed and crossed the room before wrapping him in a hug. I could tell right away that it was a different person, even if the body was the same. I felt something that I never had before.

It was warm and safe.

He gasped between muffled sobs. My tiny shoulder was pressed up against his mouth as I hugged him, so he struggled to speak.

‚ÄúWhen you and I would switch, I only took your place for a few minutes at a time. Besides that, I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äì well, a *person* before. I don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I responded quickly. ‚ÄúNo one does.‚Äù

He took three shallow breaths. ‚ÄúWhen I was in your place‚Ä¶ your father broke me a little bit more with each visit. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be fixed.‚Äù

Guilt overwhelmed me. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I breathed deeply. ‚ÄúWell, maybe fixing isn‚Äôt something that happens once. Maybe being fixed just means that you always try to get a little better.‚Äù

He looked down at me, eyes wide in the weak moonlight. ‚ÄúHow can I possibly do that?‚Äù

I let go of the hug, took him by the hand, and sat us both down on the edge of my bed. 

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I began, ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôve always wanted was someone to [listen](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).‚Äù

She told me to clock out and go to the emergency room right away to get checked out. It took a while to figure out why she was so panicked but long story short she thinks (yes present tense because no amount of assurance convinced her other wise) that my IUD is plugging up my uterus and that all of my period blood is stuck in there. She wanted me to go to the ER because she is absolutely sure that I need the IUD removed so the blood can drain before it becomes toxic and I get TSS. This is a 45 year old mother of 3.  She cannot wrap her head around the fact that the IUD affects my hormones and thus my body doesn‚Äôt create the lining in my uterus that becomes a period.

When my co-worker was a child, they used to have a neighbour. And said neighbour's landlord was a complete douchebag. She would charge rent for anything and everything which is in her house and looked for who knows how many excuses just to be able to charge more rent. She even charged more rent simply because their neighbour would use the fireplace. So one day the neighbour moved out, but not without leaving a little gift. The neighbour went to a fish-market, got an eel and then hid it in the fireplace.

What lead my co-worker to tell me this story was that his mother, who still lives there, called him yesterday. She told him, that ever since the neighbour moved out, the house wasn't rented to anybody else ever again. And the landlord still didn't firgure out that the neighbour put an eel into the fireplace.

Edit: I forgot to mention that the whole house started smelling like rotting fish soon after the neighbour moved out. And from what my co-worker told me, the smell still lingers, apparently.

Thanks for the question, ToxicFi7h. I definetly would have forgotten to put that little info in case somebody does ask.

Edit 2: Before more people are going to ask me if legal action was taken or not, that's something I can't answer. My co-worker didn't go into detail with that. Neither did I ask about that. And also, thanks for all the upvotes. My co-worker's going to be excited about this."

Now I find out my neighbor is one too!? Just fucking great. 

I‚Äôve had a huge emperor scorpion for 5 years now. I got him when I was 13 and I‚Äôve taken great care of him ever since. Just one problem; he can be super aggressive. You can handle him just fine, but if you shake around or grab him then he will not hesitate to sting the shit out of you. It‚Äôs no worse than a bee sting but it still hurts regardless. I usually don‚Äôt let people handle him because I don‚Äôt want them to get stung and accidentally drop him, but I make exceptions for the few people that know how. 

This story takes place last Saturday when my Mom had a party and invited a bunch of neighbors. Two of them being EM and her kid DS (Dumbshit). From the get-go I can tell DS is bratty. I caught him pulling my dog‚Äôs tail twice, knocking shit over, and whining for food and attention the majority of the party. EM thought this was adorable meanwhile everyone else is just annoyed. There were other little kids there who were perfectly behaved, so DS has no excuse. About an hour in, my Mom approaches me with DS whining at her feet. She tells me DS is bored and that he wants to see my room. I don‚Äôt like this because I have a lot of breakable shit up there and I know he‚Äôs gonna want to hold the scorpion. 

I reluctantly take him upstairs and before I know it he‚Äôs putting his grubby little hands all over my stuff. I didn‚Äôt mind as long as he didn‚Äôt throw or smash anything, which knowing this sprog was likely to happen. I let him snoop around for a while, and before I can tell him time‚Äôs up he points to my terrarium and shouts ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS IN THERE‚Äù. I tell him it‚Äôs not safe but he doesn‚Äôt care. He straight up runs over to it, rips the lid off, and looks for whatever is inside. I see the scorpion back into his den and I can tell he isn‚Äôt happy. I shoo DS away and tell him it‚Äôs not a safe animal. This makes him angry and he yells ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT CARE! I WANNA SEE IT!‚Äù I tell him no again, and DS screams. This little shit clearly wasn‚Äôt used to not getting his way. 

The scorpion is now scuttling around the enclosure after being spooked by the noise DS was making. DS presses his face to the glass of the terrarium and hawks at the animal. He turns to me.

DS: ‚ÄúI WANNA HOLD IT!!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù 

DS: ‚ÄúBUT I WANT TO!‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúAgain, it‚Äôs not safe. He stings, and I don‚Äôt want you to drop him.‚Äù

DS: ‚ÄúSO? IF HE STINGS ME I‚ÄôLL JUST THROW HIM!!‚Äù 

Me: ‚Äú*pissed off* ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking dare.‚Äù

DS shuts up and I gently let the scorpion walk on to my hand. I put him a few inches over my desk and let him scuttle around for a little bit while DS watches.

DS: ‚ÄúSO AM I GONNA GET TO HOLD HIM OR NOT?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI already told you no. I don‚Äôt want you to get hurt.‚Äù

DS: ‚ÄúI WANT TO! I WANT TO! I WANT TO!‚Äù 

DS is on the verge of a temper tantrum now, but I‚Äôm not gonna give in to some little kid‚Äôs demands. 

Me: *looks him right in the face* ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

This brat starts fucking wailing and jumping up and down. I feel a sharp pain in my forearm and turn to see the scorpions stinger buried in it. I quickly try to put him back in the terrarium but not before DS GRABS it out of my hands. Of course the scorpion stings him right on his finger. DS lets out an ear splitting screech and drops the scorpion on the desk and I scoop him into the terrarium. I don‚Äôt attempt to calm DS down because he brought this on himself. I hear both EM and my Mom race upstairs and EM starts screaming at me. 

EM: ‚ÄúWHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM!?‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúNothing. EK got stung by my scorpion.‚Äù

EM: ‚ÄúAND YOU DIDN‚ÄôT HELP HIM!?‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúNo, he snatched it out of my hands after I repeatedly told him it was -‚Äú 

EM: ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TALK BACK TO ME!‚Äù 

M: ‚ÄúIs this true, DS?‚Äù 

DS nods but then goes on to say he wanted to hold it. 

M: *turns to EM who‚Äôs still berating me* ‚ÄúSo let me get this straight; your kid wouldn‚Äôt listen to my son‚Äôs warnings, and then grabbed a dangerous animal because he was told no? Sounds like he needs to learn some respect‚Äù 

EM: ‚ÄúIF YOUR SON HERE WASN‚ÄôT SUCH A SELFISH LITTLE SHIT THIS WOULDN‚ÄôT HAVE HAPPENED!!!‚Äù 

M: ‚ÄúIf *your* son wasn‚Äôt such a dumbass this would have happened.‚Äù 

EM: ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU‚Äù

I shit you not EM demanded she be allowed to kill my pet scorpion. My Dad came in and told her that if she touched me or my pet then he would throw her down the stairs. EM grabs her wailing kid by the wrist and drags him out of the house, but not before saying she was going to sue us. Good luck bitch. "

I remember being starved because I had ‚Äúeaten too much‚Äù, all I wanted was an apple, but no, I was already too fat and that wasn‚Äôt acceptable. I cut this parent off at age 12, but the abuse I received while they were in my life stuck with me. I have always felt worthless, that my life was not worth the same as another. 

When I began to gain weight, it became really easy for me to give up on myself, because that was all I was worth. My mental health deteriorated, I was eating take out three meals a day and I wasn‚Äôt getting out of bed if I didn‚Äôt have to. This took a toll on my relationship with my partner, my family and my friendships. I gained a total of 21 kilos, I watched the scales up and kept going ‚Äúoh, there‚Äôs another kilo, just give up on yourself already‚Äù. 

My partner paid for 12 months of gym for me, I went a total of 5 times, he paid over $800 in gym fees for me, and I went 5 times! It started to hurt to sleep, hurt to breathe, hurt to walk.. Then something happened, and something inside of me just clicked, I needed to change.

September 13, 2017 I began my journey, and now, March 13, 2019 I have since lost 25 kilos, I have began ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù what I put in my body, I go to the gym regularly and put myself first. The biggest thing I‚Äôve lost, is my mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worth this, so I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù. 

‚Äî The photo on the left wasn‚Äôt at my highest weight, the bigger I got, the less photos were taken.

I didn't go to the restaurant, I made the order online through a delivery app. After an hour of waiting for my order to be delivered, no one arrives. 

I call the restaurant to ask about my order, and the owner picks up the phone. I ask him about the status of my order, and he was all like - ""We already delivered your food. Do you *honestly* believe for one second that it would take an hour just to deliver cheese sticks?"". 

I didn't appreciate the way he was talking to me, and I calmly say - ""Sir, you don't have to get an attitude"", and then he cuts me off and says - ""Wait...here's an idea, how about you never order from me again?"" I hung up the phone and he tried calling me back to say more stuff, but I wasn't having it. 

What an asshole. I later looked up more reviews about the restaurant, and it appears other people have had issues with this guy as well. Apparently he's racist, chauvinistic and gives his customers a lot of attitude. The worst part is that he's the owner of the restaurant. I want to report him, but I feel like he's untouchable. The restaurant he works at is privately owned, and isn't ruled by a higher power (corporate). It's a shame he's allowed to treat his customers however he wants and nothing is done about it.

Edit: I received my mozzarella sticks 10 minutes later."

They want to take the dinner shuttle to go to a strip club. 

Taking the shuttle that late isn't unusual, but I'm limited in the places I can go. Airport, restaurants, and some local businesses we have contracts with are ok, but nowhere else.

So I tell them that I can take them where they want to go, but they need to list one of these places on the log. Specifically, the Lazer eye surgery clinic that shares a parking lot with the strip club. The following conversation occurs

BRO: but we don't need surgery?
ME: I know, but it shares a parking lot with the club you are looking for
BRO: why don't you just take us to the club?
ME: I will, but you have to request one of the businesses on the list.
BRO: but we don't need any surgery?

We went back and forth, this guy simply not understanding what ""they share a parking lot"" means. I suggested that they just write down the word ""restaurant"" on the form, but got the same response ""we don't want to go to a restaurant""

Anyways, after about 10 minutes, I decided that this group was too stupid to go to the club tonight, and asked them to just go away."

Plenty of grocery stores sell them in bulk (look in ethnic stores or Fresh Thyme in the midwest) so you only need to buy what you need, and they're stupid cheap.

&#x200B;

The basics:

**Mexican**‚Äîpaprika, chilli powder, cumin, cayenne, cilantro, garlic.

**Indian**‚Äîturmeric, cumin, cardamom (it's zesty like citrus!), garam masala, ginger, garlic.

**Italian**‚Äîbasil, oregano (they both taste a bit like aniseed so if that's not your thing use them sparingly), thyme, parsley, rosemary, sage, garlic, and red pepper flakes for heat.

**Chinese**‚Äîgarlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, star anise (aniseed-y again).

**Thai**‚Äîlemon grass, coriander, cloves, nutmeg, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes. These are strong flavours so go easy on them. Fish sauce adds an umami boost.

&#x200B;

Get yourself garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, paprika, chilli powder, cumin, turmeric, oregano, rosemary, and coriander and you'll have all the basics of five major world cuisines in your pantry. The other generic staples I use are garlic salt and an Italian herb mix. Also get bay leaves. Your tastebuds will thank you.

&#x200B;

You don't have to be MasterChef to start seasoning everything. 

‚ÄîIf you're roasting chicken for meal prep, sprinkle Italian herbs over the top, put a bay leaf underneath, and crack a garlic clove or two and toss them in the same pan.

‚ÄîWhen making a pot roast, add a couple of teaspoons of thyme (or one each of thyme and rosemary), two garlic cloves, and a bay leaf.

‚ÄîAnything broth-based, steamed, or roasted, add a bay leaf.

‚ÄîTry sage with white meat or pork. It's lovely sprinkled over a chicken or pork chops before roasting.

‚ÄîAdd a cinnamon stick to a pot roast or curry.  
‚ÄîUse nutmeg (sparingly!) in cream or tomato based Italian dishes.

‚ÄîPut a tablespoon of cocoa powder in your chilli when you add the other spices.

‚ÄîAdd paprika to any savoury dish that's ""missing something.""

&#x200B;

A couple of simple recipes that'll feed a family of four (or provide plenty of leftovers):

&#x200B;

**Pot Roast**

2-3lb chuck roast

2lb potatoes, cubed

1lb carrots, sliced

1 large onion, sliced

32oz beef stock

Seasonings: 2T plain flour, 2t thyme (or 1t thyme + 1t rosemary or tarragon), 1T salt, 2t pepper, 2 garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves.

Mix your thyme, salt, pepper into the flour and dredge the meat. Brown it for best flavour but if you're in a rush it's not the end of the world. If you've any flour left over toss the veggies in it. Throw meat and veg into slow cooker. Add 2 garlic cloves and 2 bay leaves. Cover with beef stock. Cook high 4hrs / low 8hrs. Thicken the broth with a cornstarch slurry if it's too thin for your liking.

*Bonus*: If you really want to jazz it up add 1T Worcestershire sauce to the beef broth.

&#x200B;

**Chinese Chicken**

1lb chicken (white/dark, whatever), cut to bitesized pieces

2 red bell peppers (capsicum), sliced into ribbons

1 large onion / bunch green onions, cut small

4 carrots, diced

2 ribs celery, diced

Seasonings: 1T ginger, 4 garlic cloves, 1/4c soy sauce, 1T honey (or 1.5T sugar), 2t red pepper flakes, sesame and olive oil.

Cook chicken on all sides until white using 1T olive oil (extra virgin not needed) and 1T sesame oil. Remove from pan. Cook garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes on a *medium-low heat* (seriously if the garlic browns you've burnt it and it won't taste the same. Treat it gently). Once fragrant add the carrots, onion, celery and cook until softened. Add chicken back to the pan. Add the bell peppers. Add 3/4c water to the soy sauce and add to the pan. Cook until veggies are done. Taste the sauce and if it's too salty (or you just like your sauce sweeter) add the honey. Thicken with a cornstarch slurry. Serve over rice.

*Bonus*: You can add anything to this basic recipe. Toss in any old veg you need to use up, or add 1T sesame seeds at the end. Last time I made it, I added a handful of golden raisins and the bursts of sweetness were amazing."

I will conceed the point up front that there are a lot of games releasing in the destiny style, and that style might be oversaturated, but I think these games have a lot of content.  

Using anthem as an example,  I have seen several posts stating why you should our shouldn't play the game with the OP claiming to have 200+ hours on the game or having played 15+ strong holds in one night. One of the largest criticisms is the lack of content. If you have 200+ hours on a game in the first month of release you are playing that game 8+ goes a day and weekends without missing a day.  No game can support that kind of play.  

You will get bored of any game after 200 hours.  It is unreasonable to expect any game to cater to that level of play.  I'm sure I will hear many examples of how x game entertained you for many hundreds of hours,  and I'm sure that's true,  but to expect that of every game is unreasonable.  I have 300+ hours on dark souls 3 for example,  but over the life of the game with many other games in between. And I get bored of dark souls.  And when I do, I go play something else and then come back to it time and again.  

We need be willing to accept that some games only have a life of 200hrs, and if you expend that in 2 weeks, it's on you for playing through it all, not the developer, because they obviously sold a product that kept you busy for that long in the first place.  

And if you say,  "" yea,  but I didn't enjoy all 200 hours!"" Then you need some self control. Games shouldn't be expected to have infinite life span to be worth $60.

*PS many other criticism of anthem are perfectly valid,  but I find this one to be a little shaky.

I almost didn't make this post because I feel so stupid, but there were so many people who wanted an update so why not. Thanks to everyone who gave advice last time.

The next morning I decided to confront my boyfriend. I wanted the truth from him, I was very upset to say the least. So I asked him who the woman was that was coming over when I was gone. He looked kind of confused, and then started chuckling. I asked him why he was laughing, and that I wasn't joking around.

He's been preparing to propose to me and one of my best friends came over to look at rings and talk about how and where he should do it. I felt really guilty for assuming that he was cheating, but even he admitted that it didn't look very good. He showed me some of the plans they had made and the texts between them, but that he is going to change things up now that I know. I kind of ruined ruined the surprise, but oh well. I called my friend afterwards and she couldn't believe what happened and we shared a few laughs. He's been working overtime to get me a ring and I don't know how I missed all the signs. She only came over twice so I guess my neighbor is not that sharp anymore, lol.

Looking back it all makes so much sense. My friend has been low-key asking about getting engaged, what kind of ring I would like etc. I feel really stupid and bad for assuming the worst, but my boyfriend doesn't hold it against me and said he would probably have handled it the same way. I'm SO happy that we're cool now, the thought of cheating was so tough on me I already called in sick Monday.

For anyone wondering, I already told him I'm going to say yes :)

I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.

&#x200B;

I come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. 

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.

&#x200B;

So when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. 

I keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.

&#x200B;

tl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their ""honour"". AITA ?

Miles and Peter obviously get the most explicit development, while Gwen seems has a more subtle one. 

Thinking about this led me to really look at my favourite of the extra Spider People, however, and it was then that I realised that we *do* get some character for them, and it's actually really important and quite genius in how adaptable it is to fit different audiences.

Stick with me here, because at first, this is going to sound weird, but not weird in the way the film has got you used to. 

Spider-Man Noir is sort of racist, and over the course of the film, learns to get over this thanks to his meeting with Miles. This is extremely important because it fits with the other hypothetical arcs of Gwen, Peni and Ham that all relate to heroism.

**EVIDENCE**: Noir is from 1933, a period of history where Americans were, uh, less than kind to African Americans and other races in general. Think back to when we meet him for the first time. He doesn't show any specific signs of prejudice at first, and is even eager to let us know that he fights Nazis. ""A lot.""

But what's the first thing he says to Miles? ""Who are you again?"" He's also the first one to take the chance to start the ring of bullying him into being a hero. Now, this doesn't seem to point towards any prejudice either due to the fact that *everyone* is bullying him, but keep in mind that this may just be a scene pointing towards the arcs of the other characters as well (Peni doesn't understand how he could be useful without technology or technological knowledge, Gwen (this is slightly more of a stretch but is based on her backstory and remarks (""Can you give your all in the critical moments?"" ""Can you get back up?"" ""He isn't ready."") doesn't appear to believe Miles can be a hero without having been through difficult trials yet, and Spider-Ham just doesn't take heroism very seriously altogether (asking irrelevant questions like the smell one)). This isn't just about Noir's reason for believing Miles can't be a hero, but the others' as well. Noir's just happens to be related to race.

**The crux of this theory** comes next. In a throwaway gag, Noir is messing around with a Rubik's Cube, and he simply doesn't understand it or any of the colours on it. Figure out the metaphor there. Note that this scene may also include a piece of Peni's hypothetical companion arc (her relying on technology to make the Goober) and Gwen's as well (this is the point where Miles' finally has his ""trial"" through the death of his uncle, and Gwen realises that this is definitely not what is going to make him a hero). Arguably, Spider-Ham has some character here too, as he doesn't take the following fight very seriously. Noir also, upon Miles coming in and revealing that his uncle is trying to kill him, has a relatively insensitive reaction. Note that during this scene Noir is also exposed to three very strong female characters (Gwen, Doc Ock and Aunt May), which may have also influenced his old fashioned values.

The next scene is the one where all three characters come to terms with Miles' status as a hero in his own right. Noir, obviously, forgets about the ""colours"" and consoles Miles as an equal. Gwen realises how much loss Miles has experienced and how little it is going to help him become a hero compared to the support she and the others can offer. Peni forgets about her tech and relates through genuine empathy (as apposed to before where she valued technology and ""ruthlessness""). Porker finally takes the situation seriously and delivers one of the most harrowing lines in the film (""sometimes you can't save everybody"").

In the final fight, Gwen gladly works with the team, her friends, Ham takes the situation quite seriously and Peni takes out a foe without using her spider mech. During their goodbyes, Gwen friendzones Miles in the best way possible, Peni expresses her gratitude, Ham leaves one of his staple cartoon weapons behind, and Noir tells us that he loves everyone (""I love you [then after a moment he adds] *all*."") He also makes it clear that he doesn't really understand the colours of the cube, but promises that he one day will.

**CONCLUSION**. Each hero, over the course of the movie, learns a few of the most important aspects of heroism.

Peni learns that it's you that makes the hero, not your tech or even your powers (because note that she doesn't seem to have any without her robot).

Gwen learns that tragedies don't make you stronger, but friends and love definitely will.

Spider-Ham realises that heroism isn't all fun and games, and that sometimes there are tough choices to make and things will be lost or left behind.

And finally, Noir learns what is possibly the most important thing; ANYONE can be a hero, regardless of race or sex. 

This is what makes Spider-Verse quite special. No matter who you are, Spider-Verse has a way of telling you that you can be a hero despite your problems. This leads us back to Miles, whose journey over the course of the film is obviously one of becoming a hero despite the difficulties, and on the contrary, Peter, who accepts the fact that *because* anyone can be a hero, he doesn't constantly need to be one himself if he doesn't want to (which goes for you as well; if you don't want to be a hero, there's no problem with that. Go start a family).

Heroes are everywhere, and just as Miles has to choose at the end of Spider-Verse, whether or not you have the potential to be one too is a simple leap of faith. 

*Damn this one got out of hand. This was a theory that really unfolded as I wrote it, so I'm sorry if it's messy, but thanks for making this far!*"
